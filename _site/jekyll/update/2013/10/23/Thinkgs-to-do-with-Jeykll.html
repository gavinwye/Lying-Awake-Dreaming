		<p>Finally I&#39;ve got Jeykll up and running, it&#39;s been a long <del>hard</del> slog. Filled with things that most people would find trivial but for certain programatically challenged individuals it can be a little troublesome getting up and running. I&#39;ve spent hours wondering why Jeykll wouldn&#39;t pass a bunch of posts (in terminal) only to find that I was in the wrong folder. I&#39;ve installed Jekyll twice and trashed the first installation and I&#39;ve titivates about the design. But none of that is getting me anywhere, so. In favour of &#39;focussing on shipping&#39; I&#39;m planning to ship what I have and make it better as and when I have the time. Here&#39;s what I plan to improve in the short term.</p>

<h2>Vertiala rhytham</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s working as well as it could and i&#39;d like to make use of the SASS plugin to simplify and unify it. That means I will have to figure out how to &#39;work&#39; SASS.</p>

<h2>Next and previous navigation</h2>

<p>Currently there is only one way to navigate between posts. Go to the archive and find the post you want. That&#39;s not great if you want to browse around. However this site is primariliy for me so I may just leave this.</p>

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if I can find a way to search the content yet but I&#39;d like to be able to in the future</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>I&#39;d like to pull them in from Delisious and auto post them if possibke</p>

<h2>Hosting</h2>

<p>Do I host in an S3 bucket or in GitHub?</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Do I need commets on here the only person who ever comments is Danny but I do like the fact that he does.</p>

<p>Thats all for now maybe I&#39;ll add to this list in the future.</p>
