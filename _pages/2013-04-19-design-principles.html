<h1>Design Principles</h1>

<p>This is an attempt to document principles that I use. Those things that pop in my head and resonate for some reason. I intend to add to these over time and refine them. It's a work in progress.</p>

<h3>What's the least you can do for the most possible return?</h3>

<p>Some people would call this \"low hanging fruit\" but being inherently lazy I prefer this. It encourages me to stop and think questioning everything.</p>

<h3>What are you doing this for?</h3>

<p>Everything you do must have a reason. Do you know what it is? Is what you are doing the best way to accomplish the immediate task at hand?</p>

<h3>Design for recommendation</h3>

<p>What Can you do to make it easy for your users and customers to recommend your site to their friends? If we think about why people make recommendation it's often because it makes them look good, think social collateral. Seth Godin said in a talk to some Google execs that geeks recommend gmail to their friends because it just works. What can you do to ensure that when people recommend you?</p>
