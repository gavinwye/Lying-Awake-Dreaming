I&#8217;ve spent hours wondering why Jeykll wouldn&#8217;t pass a bunch of posts (in terminal) only to find that I was in the wrong folder. I&#8217;ve installed Jekyll twice and trashed the first installation and I&#8217;ve titivates about the design. But none of that is getting me anywhere, so. In favour of &#8216;focussing on shipping&#8217; I&#8217;m planning to ship what I have and make it better as and when I have the time.

Go to the archive and find the post you want. That&#8217;s not great if you want to browse around. However this site is primariliy for me so I may just leave this.</p>\n\n<h2>Search</h2>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I can find a way to search the content yet but I&#8217;d like to be able to in the future</p>\n\n<h2>Links</h2>\n\n<p>I&#8217;d like to pull them in from Delisious and auto post them if possible</p>\n\n<h2>Hosting</h2>\n\n<p>Do I host in an S3 bucket or in GitHub?</p>\n\n<h2>Comments</h2>\n\n<p>Do I need commets on here the only person who ever comments is Danny but I do like the fact that he does. Okay mybe, from time to time other people have commented.</p>\n\n<p>Thats all for now, maybe I&#8217;ll add to this list in the future.</p>\n\n","date":"2013-11-12T00:00:00Z","slug":"/article/things-to-do-with-jeykll","published":true,"title":"Things to do with Jeykll 1","<!-- layout":"post -->"},"FilePath":"/collections/article/Things-to-do-with-Jeykll.md","Date":"2013-11-12T00:00:00Z"},"/collections/article/markdown-example.md":{"Prefix":"article","Published":true,"Url":"/article/markdown-example","FilePath":"/collections/article/markdown-example.md","Date":"2013-06-11T00:00:00Z","Meta":{"body":"\n<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&#8220;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.

Where I want it, is in documents that are easy to repurpose for who knows what in the future.

However I get a lot of mail and I&#8217;ve been getting more and more busy lately so I have stopped checking the not important stuff. The sort of stuff that I don&#8217;t want to junk but don&#8217;t want to read now.</p>\n\n<p>So I created a rule quickly (which is where everything went wrong) to put everything from the people whose mail I hadn&#8217;t read in the last month in a folder called NQJBNTI (Not Quite Junk But Not That Important). I did it just before <a title=\"Business Bricks\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/215585/\" target=\"_blank\">Business Bricks</a> on Friday and then someone came in so I didn&#8217;t finish the task properly. I just shut my laptop and forgot about it.</p>\n\n<p>Because I had forgotten about the rule and not checked my mail for the rest of Friday or the weekend by the time it got to Monday and I checked my mail and didn&#8217;t get some mails from people who had sent them to me I immediately thought it must have been a problem with the mail server.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke to <a title=\"Symon\" href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/symonc/\" target=\"_blank\">Symon</a> and he told me to telnet in to the mail server so that I could see if there was mail there (this is apparently the same protocol as mail.app uses) so that proves that mail is working. I installed Packet Peeper to sniff the packets and everything is working fine. I created a new mail account and could receive mail on that account. So the server is working and so is mail.app. Then Dave said the only thing left is a problem with rules but I can&#8217;t see that being a problem! Rules I did something in there on Friday! I checked and the rule was set to exclude all mail from my in box unless it was from one person. Doh!</p>\n\n<p>So the moral of the story is check the simple stuff first, and try and remember what you did yesterday!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway the real point of this post is here&#8217;s how to telnet in to a mail server which I found really cool.
