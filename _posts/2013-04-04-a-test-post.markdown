<p>I'm using IA writer, Calepin and IFTTT to auto post to my blog I have in the past been using Marse edit or the Wordpress editor bit It's just not as convenient as using IA writer as I use it for most things from lists to article and notes. It's basically my one killer app.</p>

<p>If this process works I'll write a more detailed set of instructions on how I'm doing it.</p>
