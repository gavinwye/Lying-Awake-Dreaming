<p>I find the model of new stuff coming in the top of my inbox, twitter feed and many other list metaphors confusing when you think about it in terms of productivity.</p>

<ul>
<li>when you write a list you put the important things at the top</li>
<li>important stuff gets done first</li>
<li>is time age a good way to prioritise </li>
<li>with things at the top its easy to miss the small stuff below </li>
<li>humans are bad at prioritising things</li>
</ul>
