<p>I use Apple&#8217;s Mail.app which is fine it is integrated nicely in to my work flow, It links to <a title="Daylight" href="http://marketcircle.com/daylite/index.html" target="_blank">Daylight</a> via DMI and most of the time it just works. However I get a lot of mail and I&#8217;ve been getting more and more busy lately so I have stopped checking the not important stuff. The sort of stuff that I don&#8217;t want to junk but don&#8217;t want to read now.</p>

<p>So I created a rule quickly (which is where everything went wrong) to put everything from the people whose mail I hadn&#8217;t read in the last month in a folder called NQJBNTI (Not Quite Junk But Not That Important). I did it just before <a title="Business Bricks" href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/215585/" target="_blank">Business Bricks</a> on Friday and then someone came in so I didn&#8217;t finish the task properly. I just shut my laptop and forgot about it.</p>

<p>Because I had forgotten about the rule and not checked my mail for the rest of Friday or the weekend by the time it got to Monday and I checked my mail and didn&#8217;t get some mails from people who had sent them to me I immediately thought it must have been a problem with the mail server.</p>

<p>I spoke to <a title="Symon" href="http://homepage.mac.com/symonc/" target="_blank">Symon</a> and he told me to telnet in to the mail server so that I could see if there was mail there (this is apparently the same protocol as mail.app uses) so that proves that mail is working. I installed Packet Peeper to sniff the packets and everything is working fine. I created a new mail account and could receive mail on that account. So the server is working and so is mail.app. Then Dave said the only thing left is a problem with rules but I can&#8217;t see that being a problem! Rules I did something in there on Friday! I checked and the rule was set to exclude all mail from my in box unless it was from one person. Doh!</p>

<p>So the moral of the story is check the simple stuff first, and try and remember what you did yesterday!</p>

<p>Anyway the real point of this post is here&#8217;s how to telnet in to a mail server which I found really cool. I love stuff like this and here&#8217;s a record for when I forget.</p>

<p>Open the terminal<br />
at the prompt ($) type telnet mailservername 110<br />
you should get a message back like Ok hello there<br />
type the following<br />
USER username<br />
It will then ask for the password for the account type:<br />
PASS password<br />
you should then get a logged in message<br />
type list<br />
you will then see a list of all the mail on the serve to read the mail type<br />
retr 1 (where 1 is the number of the mail)<br />
to quit type quit</p>
