        "body": "\n<p>I use Apple&#8217;s Mail.app which is fine it is integrated nicely in to my work flow, It links to <a title=\"Daylight\" href=\"http://marketcircle.com/daylite/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Daylight</a> via DMI and most of the time it just works. However I get a lot of mail and I&#8217;ve been getting more and more busy lately so I have stopped checking the not important stuff. The sort of stuff that I don&#8217;t want to junk but don&#8217;t want to read now.</p>\n\n<p>So I created a rule quickly (which is where everything went wrong) to put everything from the people whose mail I hadn&#8217;t read in the last month in a folder called NQJBNTI (Not Quite Junk But Not That Important). I did it just before <a title=\"Business Bricks\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/215585/\" target=\"_blank\">Business Bricks</a> on Friday and then someone came in so I didn&#8217;t finish the task properly. I just shut my laptop and forgot about it.</p>\n\n<p>Because I had forgotten about the rule and not checked my mail for the rest of Friday or the weekend by the time it got to Monday and I checked my mail and didn&#8217;t get some mails from people who had sent them to me I immediately thought it must have been a problem with the mail server.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke to <a title=\"Symon\" href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/symonc/\" target=\"_blank\">Symon</a> and he told me to telnet in to the mail server so that I could see if there was mail there (this is apparently the same protocol as mail.app uses) so that proves that mail is working. I installed Packet Peeper to sniff the packets and everything is working fine. I created a new mail account and could receive mail on that account. So the server is working and so is mail.app. Then Dave said the only thing left is a problem with rules but I can&#8217;t see that being a problem! Rules I did something in there on Friday! I checked and the rule was set to exclude all mail from my in box unless it was from one person. Doh!</p>\n\n<p>So the moral of the story is check the simple stuff first, and try and remember what you did yesterday!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway the real point of this post is here&#8217;s how to telnet in to a mail server which I found really cool. I love stuff like this and here&#8217;s a record for when I forget.</p>\n\n<p>Open the terminal<br />\nat the prompt ($) type telnet mailservername 110<br />\nyou should get a message back like Ok hello there<br />\ntype the following<br />\nUSER username<br />\nIt will then ask for the password for the account type:<br />\nPASS password<br />\nyou should then get a logged in message<br />\ntype list<br />\nyou will then see a list of all the mail on the serve to read the mail type<br />\nretr 1 (where 1 is the number of the mail)<br />\nto quit type quit</p>\n",

Filled with things that most people would find trivial but for certain programatically challenged individuals it can be a little troublesome getting up and running. I&#8217;ve spent hours wondering why Jeykll wouldn&#8217;t pass a bunch of posts (in terminal) only to find that I was in the wrong folder. I&#8217;ve installed Jekyll twice and trashed the first installation and I&#8217;ve titivates about the design. But none of that is getting me anywhere, so. In favour of &#8216;focussing on shipping&#8217; I&#8217;m planning to ship what I have and make it better as and when I have the time. Here&#8217;s what I plan to improve in the short term.</p>\n\n<h2>Vertical rhytham</h2>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s working as well as it could and i&#8217;d like to make use of the SASS plugin to simplify and unify it. That means I will have to figure out how to &#8216;work&#8217; SASS.</p>\n\n<h2>Previous and next navigation</h2>\n\n<p>Currently there is only one way to navigate between posts. Go to the archive and find the post you want. That&#8217;s not great if you want to browse around. However this site is primariliy for me so I may just leave this.</p>\n\n<h2>Search</h2>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I can find a way to search the content yet but I&#8217;d like to be able to in the future</p>\n\n<h2>Links</h2>\n\n<p>I&#8217;d like to pull them in from Delisious and auto post them if possible</p>\n\n<h2>Hosting</h2>\n\n<p>Do I host in an S3 bucket or in GitHub?</p>\n\n<h2>Comments</h2>\n\n<p>Do I need commets on here the only person who ever comments is Danny but I do like the fact that he does. Okay mybe, from time to time other people have commented.</p>\n\n<p>Thats all for now, maybe I&#8217;ll add to this list in the future.</p>\n\n",

I don’t use all of the features that Wordpress has to offer so <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> seems a bit more simple, a bit more light weight.</p>\n\n<p>There are three main thoughts driving this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On the face of it Jekyll also offers me more options to easily customise pages and things quickly on the fly and it fits more with my most recent thoughts about how I want to handle my content.</li>\n<li>I really don’t want my content locked away in a database, making it hard to get at in the future, when I change my mind. Where I want it, is in documents that are easy to repurpose for who knows what in the future. I write most things in <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a> so at this point in time Jekyll seems to fit with these current thoughts.</li>\n<li>I exchanged <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gavinwye/status/368674918809890817\">Tweets</a> with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markirby\">@markkirby</a> at the weekend, He’s thinking of doing the same and we said we would exchange notes at <a href=\"http://2013.dconstruct.org/\">dConstruct</a> in September, I don’t want to turn up empty handed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I’ll try to document the process but all I have at the moment are the questions below which I’ll come back and answer as and when.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Should I host the static pages on a server? I’ll host in in AWS anyway but do I need the extra power of the server</li>\n<li>Should I try to set an <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html\">AWS bucket</a> and serve it from there?</li>\n<li>If I set up an S3 bucket can I find a good simple way to mount it locally so that the deployment is easy?</li>\n<li>Can I script deployment to this S3 bucket so that when I write something and I’m ready to be published it’s quick and easy?</li>\n<li>Can I use <a href=\"http://hammerformac.com/\">Hammer For Mac</a> in some way or will I have to use <a href=\"http://middlemanapp.com/\">Middleman</a>?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I’ll update this post as I go with more questions and answers as I come to them.

Now it&#8217;s London&#8217;s turn. The first event is in August. Titled <a href=\"skillswaplondon-august.eventbrite.co.uk\">Talking About Design</a> we have two very fine speakers <a href=\"andybudd.com\">Andy Budd</a> and Jonty Sharples](3tych.com).</p>\n\n<p>Website coming soon</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.uxcampbrighton.org/\">UX Camp Brighton</a></h2>\n\n<p>A one day Barcamp style event where everyone is a speaker.

Similar to developer ‘hackdays’ the aim is to get designers, developers, and more together to learn and collaborate with each other while working on actual design problems. The sessions champion open-source thinking &amp; sharing and are non-profit, run by local volunteers. Organised in collaboration with <a href=\"twitter.com/alicenwondrlnd\">Alison Austin</a>, <a href=\"www.cennydd.co.uk\">Cennydd Bowles</a> and <a href=\"twitter.com/patrick_sansom\">Patrick Sansom</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.designjams.org/wiki/Design_Jam_Brighton\">Read more about the event</a></p>\n\n",

If we think about why people make recommendation it&#8217;s often because it makes them look good, think social collateral.
