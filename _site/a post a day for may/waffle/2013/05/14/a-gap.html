		<p>It's been 13 days since Last posted in my 'A Post A Day For May' challenge. Yes it really is a challenge. Trying to come up with something original to say every day. Find the time to write it, in a way that is interesting to read, is quite a tall order.</p>

<p>It's not that I'm short on ideas. Here's a quick snapshot of my current writing list. Feel free to use the comments if there is something that you'd like to hear more about.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stupid testing</li>
<li>HTML5 and mobile capabilities (research)</li>
<li>The importance of wireframes</li>
<li>Playing to your strengths</li>
<li>Workflow - from Siri to Things</li>
<li>Javascript and accessibility </li>
<li>Real copy in wireframes</li>
<li>Web push notifications for the mobile web (research)</li>
<li>How to write annotations</li>
<li>File name formats</li>
<li>LinkedIn endorsements and value</li>
<li>Your website as a framework</li>
</ul>

<p>And with that I may get back on track. More tomorrow.</p>
