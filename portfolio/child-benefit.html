<h3>Child Benefit discovery</h3>

I lead on the discovery phase of the Child benefit service. Mentoring a junior User Researcher, guiding them and carrying out much of the user research. We collaboratively conducted field research with users at home and used insight generated from this to identify user needs and opportunities to meet these needs.

During discovery, I also worked with business analysts to ensure that the team understood the business processes planning likely changes to meet the needs of users and assessing the impact of these changes on the business.

I facilitated co-design workshops with subject matter experts from key areas of the business. Using their broder knowledge to define solutions to the needs of their users ranking these solutions in order of value to users and the business and also the complexity involved in acheving them.

Following on from that workshop I worked with the team to define the ideal journey.

And then rapidly to prototype the journey so that we could start to conduct user research to test and refine the journey.
