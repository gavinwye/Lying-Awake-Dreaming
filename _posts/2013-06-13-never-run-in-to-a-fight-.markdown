<p>and never start a fight you can't win.</p>

<p>I was asked a few months ago what the best piece of advice I had ever been given was and this is it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never run in to a fight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This advice was given to my by a friend who had been in the Royal Marines for many years. He'd been shot at, shot at people and seen friends shot. Running in to a fight in his world leads to you and other people around you getting shot and possibly killed. He said it in a way that gave it such gravitas that I remember it frequently.</p>

<p>Over the years I've added the last part, 'never start a fight you can't win'. Recently I've been working on a project that has unwittingly come to embody this little slogan. Not that the other people who are involved in the project actually know this. But so far the project has gone without a hitch.</p>

<p>Meetings with clients have felt well rehearsed everyone know what they are expected to do and plays their part. In short there have been no surprises. We have shared <del>deliverables</del> artefacts with clients well in advance of the meeting's. I used to think this kind of forward planning spoiled the show, but I was wrong. I used to lack the conviction in my ideas and rationale and written communication that would prevent me from sharing things. I preferred instead to ambush clients with my brilliance. Again I was wrong.</p>
