I used to call these side projects until I read [this post][5] by Paul Jarvis on 99U. I like the way it's framed and the idea resonated with me. So often in the past I've starting something just because it seemed like a good idea. I want to do things that have an impact. 

When something is an experiment it has a purpose; to either validate or invalidate an idea. For me that has more value. 

## SkillSwap London

I'm bringing SkillSwap to London. SkillSwap is a series of tiny free speaking events they have been running in [Brighton](brighton.skillswap.org) and [Bristol](bristolskillswap.org) for ages. Now it's London's turn. The first event is in August. Titled [Talking About Design](skillswaplondon-august.eventbrite.co.uk) we have two very fine speakers [Andy Budd](andybudd.com) and Jonty Sharples](3tych.com).

## [Design Jam Brighton][4] 

Design Jam is a one-day design session, during which people will team up to tackle engaging User Experience (UX) challenges. Similar to developer ‘hackdays’ the aim is to get designers, developers, and more together to learn and collaborate with each other while working on actual design problems. The sessions champion open-source thinking & sharing and are non-profit, run by local volunteers. Organised in collaboration with [Alison Austin](twitter.com/alicenwondrlnd), [Cennydd Bowles](www.cennydd.co.uk) and [Patrick Sansom](twitter.com/patrick_sansom)
