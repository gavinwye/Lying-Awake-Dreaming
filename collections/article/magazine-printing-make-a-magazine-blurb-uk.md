Looks like a great way to get large documents or specs printed even though I normally advocate building a site for a project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Printed on demand, our Magazines are simple to design and easy to update as you'd like. And they start at just £6.99, making them so affordable you can order as many as you want. Think eye-catching portfolios, elegant product catalogues, your very own monthly publication – at 8.5 x 11 inches (22 x 28 cm), Blurb Magazines make great leave-behinds and promotional pieces that won't make a big dent in your budget.</p>
