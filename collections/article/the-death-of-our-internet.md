<p>Recently at work there has been a very soft launch of an intranet. It's been a long time in the making and it's a positive step forward, so I want to be careful what I say about it. However I think we lost something. We are now all standing in the same room talking about the same thing. There is a danger that we create a microcosm.</p>

<ul>
<li>we should be talking in the open</li>
<li>most of the things are just links </li>
</ul>
