I have just finished the brochure and website (which I worked on with <a title="Ben's blog" href="http://www.redbeard.org.uk/" target="_blank">Ben</a> he did the back end. I did the front end) for the <a title="Streatham Festival website" href="http://www.streathamfestival.com" target="_blank">Streatham Festival</a> that will take place during the week of the July 5th – July 13th. It looks like its going to be a great festival with a packed lineup.

It was a really nice project to work on and I think the results achieved justified the late nights and weekends it took to get it all done.

Thanks to all involved it was lots of fun, see you at the festival.
