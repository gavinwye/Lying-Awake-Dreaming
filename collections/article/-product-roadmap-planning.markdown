You've convinced the client they should not be shipping a product loaded full of features that their customers will likely never use. But how do you then get the right features in to the backlog? How do you ensure that these features will add to the usefulness of the product, and that they are not added on a whim?



A product crammed full of features that do not provide a tangible benefit for the business and its customers is not really a very good product. In fact lots of features bundled together is just that: a bundle of features. To make a good product you need to glue all of the features together with something that means something to the people who are going to be using the product. This glue also needs to provide value for the people who are producing the product. This glue in my opinion should be the benefit that the product provides for these two very different groups of people.



Ask any half decent salesman if they sell features or benefits and he will most likely recite verbatim "Sell benefits not features".



So why when we are building products for the web do we constantly fall in to the trap of prioritising features and forget about the benefits these features provide, for our customers? Because a feature is a lot easier to estimate and build than a benefit.



Benefits take time to think about and communicate to people. Sometimes the benefit is only clear when a few different features are grouped together.



Take Basecamp, the popular project collaboration tool from 37 Signals for example. If you list its features you'd get something like; to-do list, messaging, calendar, file storage with optional group chat and writing. Take away one of the first four of those features and you loose the benefit, collaboration. Yes, granted some of them are not mutually exclusive. The to-do list for example is a stand alone product Ta-Da List. But the benefit is different and so are the users.

If the benefit is not intrinsically linked to the feature or group of features it's all too easy for them to be prioritised upwards or downwards according to the most important or loudest person’s viewpoint. That doesn't matter too much if you have a small consistent team who all own the vision, but this isn’t scalable on a large project with multiple stakeholders. Helping people to make the right decision for the product, by providing a clear decision making framework can be very helpful.



So we need to start ensuring that all of the features that we design and build are intrinsically linked to the benefit that they provide. But how can we do that? There are two key things that we can start to think about. Alignment and mapping.

Alignment means that everything that you are doing should be directly aligned to the vision for the product. If it's not aligned to that vision then why are you doing it? Either your vision is wrong or you're wasting resources on something that won't give you or your customers the benefit that you set out to. You must continually check your ideas against the insight that you have gathered. It's not enough to know what you are doing. You need to know why you are doing it. What's more everyone in the team should know why you are doing it. If people know the &#95;why, the &#95;what becomes a lot easier. You can stop having 'what if' conversations and start talking about the realities of what you know to be true.



If you don't know something to be true then you have two choices: Either do some research to test your ideas or park it for the time being. You can always revisit something later in the lifecycle of a product. I'm personally in favour of parking as much as possible. The less work you take on, the more chance you have of getting something out the door, and that should be your primary focus. The benefit of building something digitally is it's relatively trivial to build and ship something. Change is easy and instant! It's unlike any other industry where change is something to be weary of.



It may seem that I'm talking about a Lean approach without actually mentioning Lean. I'm not. What I'm talking about is good design. I do think about Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and other things associated with the Lean movement when I'm working, but not at the expense of the experience. Minimum Viable Experience perhaps? It's just common sense; do less better rather than everything all at once to a mediocre standard. None of what I'm saying suggests that you should be shipping a half finished product. It's about shipping a product that hits the sweet spot. Yes none of this is a new idea.



So lets pretend that you have parked everything that you think may work and are going to design and build things that you know will hit that sweet spot.



You can start to map these features against the benefit that they will provide either to you or your customers. But that still doesn't really give you a complete product. You need to start mapping all of this so that you get a few key journeys that you can start designing those journeys. (You've actually been designing for a long time already, design is not just about quietly sketching wireframes anymore.) You'll then be able to asses which of these journeys provides the most benefit and prioritise your work.



Grouping features in this way means that you can assign value to them. You also get complete tasks or journeys that can be designed end to end.



I worked on an agile project a few years ago and we didn't do this. We were designing to user stories which had been prioritised against the amount of effort that they would take to complete. Both from a development and design perspective. Towards the end of the project, we started to notice 'cracks' appearing. These 'cracks' appeared in the gaps between sprints. We went back and filled in these cracks and everything worked fine. Looking back now, it wasn't as big a drama as it felt at the time. But there were two valuable lessons. Sketching out wireframes is not where the design starts or ends, and when it seems as if your world is falling apart the problem is probably not as big as you think it is. The design starts well before this in the initial stages of the project. The tools of choice for this are experience maps and user journeys. If you're not inputting into the initial stages of the project plan - which as I said is really design - and the roadmap for the product, you're not doing your job as a designer.

Aligning and mapping features and benefits in this way means that you can decide where you should be spending your budget for the highest possible return. How you quantify that return is up to you.



As designers we have valuable skills that we can use to help facilitate this planning- design process. But we would be foolish to think that we can do this in complete isolation. Unless you truly are a unicorn. Spending your own money and defining your own success. Collaboration and facilitation are the keys to success.
