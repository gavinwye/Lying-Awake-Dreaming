<h1>SkillSwap London</h1>

I'm bringing SkillSwap to London. SkillSwap is a series of tiny free speaking events they have been running in <a href=\"brighton.skillswap.org\">Brighton</a> and <a href=\"bristolskillswap.org\">Bristol</a> for ages. Now it's London's turn. The first event is in August. Titled <a href=\"skillswaplondon-august.eventbrite.co.uk\">Talking About Design</a> we have two very fine speakers <a href=\"andybudd.com\">Andy Budd</a> and <a href=\"3tych.com\">Jonty Sharples</a>. We are being sponsored and hosted by <a href=\"think.eu\">TH_NK</a>.



Website coming soon.

<h1><a href="http://www.designjams.org/wiki/Design_Jam_Brighton">Design Jam Brighton</a></h1>

Design Jam is a one-day design session, during which people will team up to tackle engaging User Experience (UX) challenges. Similar to developer ‘hackdays’ the aim is to get designers, developers, and more together to learn and collaborate with each other while working on actual design problems. The sessions champion open-source thinking &amp; sharing and are non-profit, run by local volunteers.



Organised in collaboration with <a href=\"twitter.com/alicenwondrlnd\">Alison Austin</a>, <a href=\"www.cennydd.co.uk\">Cennydd Bowles</a> and <a href=\"twitter.com/patrick_sansom\">Patrick Sansom</a>
