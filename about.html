	</h1>

	<hr>

	<p>I've spent the last 18 years working in Digital Product Design and User Experience roles. I have a BA Hons in Product Design.</p>
	<p>Over the last seven years. I've helped departments within the UK Government build strong multidisciplinary design teams and establish hugely successful design operations and practices.</p>
	<p>I’m driven by the desire to make things better, to deliver impactful working software to users as early as possible, meeting their needs, continuously improving and iterating based on user research. </p>
	<p>I've worked across the UK Government – on citizen facing services for:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">The Ministry of Justice</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/her-majestys-prison-and-probation-service">Her Majesty’s Prison & Probation Service</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/legal-aid-agency">The Legal Aid Agency</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/criminal-injuries-compensation-authority">Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs">HM Revenue & Customs</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>And in the private sector for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Virgin Money</li>
			<li>Nando's worldwide</li>
			<li>J.K.Rowlings' Pottermore</li>
			<li>Visa</li>
			<li>and</li>
			<li>Channel4</li>
		</ul>

	<p>I've had many job titles over the last 18 years. I prefer to use the word <b>Designer</b>.</p>
	<p>I focus on doing the right thing at the right time rather than obsess over job titles.</p>
	<p>Separating design into specific sub-disciplines like Product, Interaction, Service, Content and even User research (which is a design discipline) is helpful when working as part of a team. However, in general, those words confuse people who are not designers.</p>
	<p>When working as part of a team, it sometimes helps to distinguish between disciplines. But we should not let this get in the way of doing the right thing and delivering value to users.</p>

	<p>I'm based in Chamonix in the French Alps where I spend as much time as I can in the mountains.</p>
