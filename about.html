	<h1>About Gavin Wye
	<span>September 2019</span>
</h1>

	<hr>

	<p>I've spent the last 18 years working in Digital Product Design and User Experience roles. I graduated from university with a BA Hons in Product Design.</p>
	<p>Over the last seven years, working as a lead designer. I've helped organisations build strong multidisciplinary design teams and establish hugely successful design operations and practices.</p>
	<p>I’m driven by the desire to make things better, to deliver impactful working software to users as early as possible, meeting their needs, continuously improving and iterating based on user research. I have excellent attention to detail but know when to compromise for the benefit of users and the business. </p>
	<p>I've worked across the UK Government – from <a href="">GOV.UK</a> to <a href="">The Ministry of Justice</a> and <a href="">HM Revenue & Customs</a> – and in the private sector for <a href="">Virgin Money</a>, <a href="">Nando's worldwide</a>, J.K.Rowlings' <a href="">Pottermore</a>, <a href="">Visa</a> and <a href="">Channel4</a>.</p>
	<!-- <p>I’ve worked as part of multidisciplinary agile teams – where I’m as comfortable committing code as I am sketching – and with senior policymakers, senior management teams and board members to help them define product capabilities and services that meet the needs of users and satisfy the goals of the organisation.</p> -->
	<!-- <p>I’m highly motivated help teams gather actionable insights from user research, generate ideas with team members then prototype, test and refine ideas further. The focus of this is always to check assumptions as quickly as possible while striving for simplicity.</p> -->
	<!-- <p>I’m an experienced facilitator who has moderated usability testing, service assessments, workshops and co-design sessions. </p> -->
