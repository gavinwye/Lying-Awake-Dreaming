A nice way to generate random profiles for web apps etc. &gt; RandomUser is an API that provides you with a randomly generated user. These users can be used as placeholders in web mockups, and will save you time from creating your own placeholder information. Delicious incorrectly recommended the tag 'persona for this but we know that's not true as there is no research backing these users up.</p>
