<p>I have just finished the brochure and website (which I worked on with <a title="Ben's blog" href="http://www.redbeard.org.uk/" target="_blank">Ben</a> he did the back end. I did the front end) for the <a title="Streatham Festival website" href="http://www.streathamfestival.com" target="_blank">Streatham Festival</a> that will take place during the week of the July 5th – July 13th. It looks like its going to be a great festival with a packed lineup.</p>

<p>It was a really nice project to work on and I think the results achieved justified the late nights and weekends it took to get it all done.</p>

<p>Thanks to all involved it was lots of fun, see you at the festival.</p>
