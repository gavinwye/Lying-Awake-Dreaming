<p><a href="https://medium.com/design-startups/6c423fc5ccef">A new slant on a old debate</a>. <a href="http://davidcole.me/">David Cole</a> from Quora describes how they design, And how the tools they have made make it easy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should designers code? It's an important conversation for our field, but the reality is that most designers can't and don't code as part of their regular process. We could argue about theoretical ideals, but technology is on the cusp of rendering the whole debate irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it's true with Github, Codepen, and other sites where the community can share and collaborate it's now easy for designers to 'cobble' together bits of code from here and there to get something up and running.</p>
