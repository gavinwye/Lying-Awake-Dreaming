As perceived complexity or importance increase so does the size of the screen people use.

Recently I've been involved in about 30 contextual interviews with new parents from all walks of life. During the course of these interviews I've noticed a particular theme emerging.

Initially they start of small reaching for the 'smart phone' normally for research. Then, as the task that they are doing increases in complexity so does the size of the screen. People have also commented that if they think of things as being more important - involving money - they want a bigger screen so they can make sure they don't make any mistakes.
