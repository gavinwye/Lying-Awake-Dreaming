		<p>I was chatting to <a href="http://yandleblog.com/">Danny</a> this morning about a problem he was asked to solve convincing a senior manager that Information Architecture (IA) is a good idea. Off the cuff I came up with this solution. He thought was worthy of a post so here it is.</p>

<p>You should use this tactic when you are working with somone who has a big personality and just thinks that things that you do are crap. It&#39;s sort of cruel &#39;cos your going to humiliate them to a certain extent, or at least thats the point. To point out the obvious which is that Information Architecture is the most important thing in a web project (probably there are probably other things that are more important like getting paid so don&#39;t embarrass them to much)
<ol>
    <li>Get a load of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Quercetti-Magnetic-Alphabet-Lower-Pieces/dp/B00068OJNU/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=toys&amp;qid=1208093357&amp;sr=8-1">fridge magnets / letters</a> its important that they are simple fridge magnets, as they have a lot of connotations with children and will help to simplify the point and bring it right down to ground level.</li>
    <li>Put all of the fridge magnets in a bin do this in front of the audience to build up the drama, you should make a lot of noise as you put them in the bin.</li>
    <li>Withhold one of the magnets, this is important.</li>
    <li>Ask the subject to look for the magnet that you have, don&#39;t leave it so long that they have a chance to find out that the letter isn&#39;t there, otherwise they will get hung up on the fact that you cheated and the whole point of the exercise will be lost.</li>
    <li>Stop them and tip the magnets on to the floor.</li>
    <li>Ask them to arrange the magnets in a way the they would find it easy to find individual ones. Your making them do a card sort here so they can&#39;t argue that they don&#39;t want to pay for this.</li>
    <li>Then ask them to find the same magnet / letter.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Hopefully you should have justified IA by now if they don&#39;t get it by that time then your in trouble &#39;cos you just had a man in a suite crawling around on the floor arranging the alphabet.</p>

<p>The staging of this will be important. You need to ask them to follow your instructions and get them to play along. It may be a good idea to do this in relative private there is a chance that they could be embarrassed by playing with kids toys.</p>
