Here's a few to kick of the new year.
<ul>
	<li>Learn about fine Scotch Whiskey and how to differentiate the good from the bad.</li>
	<li>Learn about Oysters and eat more of them.</li>
	<li>Forage for more food including going fishing every now and then.</li>
	<li>Write at lease one post here every week.</li>
	<li>Do things that are productive and add value.</li>
	<li>Don't be a slave to email.</li>
	<li>Don’t moan about things instead frame the problem and find a solution.</li>
</ul>
I'm writing all this down so that I can look back and see how I did at the end of the year. I think it will give me impetus to do something about it. I did this when I gave up smoking and that worked.
<blockquote><em>Tip: I smoked for quite a long time, and giving up was really really hard. The best tactic that I found when giving up was to tell as many people as possible that I was giving up. <em>Then you have to do it. Not following thorough would have meant letting those people down.</em></em></blockquote>
It also helps me set some constraints to write within.<em> </em> I'm going to write something here once a week. Hopefully it will be fun, informative and punchy. It will probably be about User Experience Design and sometimes about working culture and the ways that knowledge workers can be more productive. There is a possibility there will be a bit about customer service. I'll try and limit myself to 500 words. I’m also not going to spend a lot of time composing these posts. I’ll do a couple of versions have a read through and then set it free. I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist and hide things away until they are finished; this often means that things don’t get finished at all or get left to rot. I’ll try not to rant or moan so I’ll try to suggest a solution. I’ll try to be reflective of things that I actually have experience of. I’ll do my research first before I write something so that what I write is informed. I’m not going to worry about if what I’m saying is completely the right thing to say at the right time. It’s about forming and articulating my opinions as I go. So that's at least one quickly written researched 500 word post a week that is fun and informative. Yes I do like a challenge, and for the record I don’t think I’m very good at writing. I feel like I should say a bit about what motivates me to write. It is primarily to educate myself and solidify my ideas, I always find that once you start discussing things and hear how they sound you can rationalise them. It’s also to make me a better designer, I’ve always thought that as a someone who works in the web industry I should share my thoughts. I think about this stuff a lot so here goes…
