<p>Incase you hadn't noticed London is full of big and small companies who will for a vastly different price design and in most cases build a website. Some claim to do strategy some do UX others just do design.</p>


<p>So what do you need to do to get a job in one of these companies? Well don't as I did a couple of years ago tell everyone you see at interview what you think you want them to hear. It won't work. Seeing as there are so many web design companies about you need to help these companies to differentiate themselves from one another. Being the same as everyone they already have wont do you any good. There are two things you need to do.</p>


<ol>
<li>Be yourself. If you try and be something your not it will end in tears. These will probably be your tears as you will be so unhappy in a company that wants you to be a square peg in a round hole.</li>
<li>Challenge them. If you don't want to work in an environment where your challenged you should probably go and do something else. The web is not a good place for you to be at the moment.</li>
</ol>
