		<p>There is a little known app called iOS simulator which I use from time to time when designing responsive sites. It’s a lot easier to get a site which is running locally as most things are in the really early stages of a project.</p>

<p>It makes it really quick for me to get something on a simulated phone and see how it will look. The alternative to this would be put the files on a server or use <a href="http://progrium.com/localtunnel/">local tunnel</a> or a similar service. However the time it would take me to figure out these solutions would take me away from designing. Which is what I want to be doing.</p>

<p>So I use a simulator to give me an idea of how the design works. It’s not an easy application to find as it’s wrapped up in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">xCode</a> which you can get for free from apple.</p>
