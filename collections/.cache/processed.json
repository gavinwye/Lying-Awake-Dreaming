However I get a lot of mail and I&#8217;ve been getting more and more busy lately so I have stopped checking the not important stuff. The sort of stuff that I don&#8217;t want to junk but don&#8217;t want to read now.</p>\n\n<p>So I created a rule quickly (which is where everything went wrong) to put everything from the people whose mail I hadn&#8217;t read in the last month in a folder called NQJBNTI (Not Quite Junk But Not That Important). I did it just before <a title=\"Business Bricks\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/215585/\" target=\"_blank\">Business Bricks</a> on Friday and then someone came in so I didn&#8217;t finish the task properly. I just shut my laptop and forgot about it.</p>\n\n<p>Because I had forgotten about the rule and not checked my mail for the rest of Friday or the weekend by the time it got to Monday and I checked my mail and didn&#8217;t get some mails from people who had sent them to me I immediately thought it must have been a problem with the mail server.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke to <a title=\"Symon\" href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/symonc/\" target=\"_blank\">Symon</a> and he told me to telnet in to the mail server so that I could see if there was mail there (this is apparently the same protocol as mail.app uses) so that proves that mail is working. I installed Packet Peeper to sniff the packets and everything is working fine. I created a new mail account and could receive mail on that account. So the server is working and so is mail.app. Then Dave said the only thing left is a problem with rules but I can&#8217;t see that being a problem! Rules I did something in there on Friday! I checked and the rule was set to exclude all mail from my in box unless it was from one person. Doh!</p>\n\n<p>So the moral of the story is check the simple stuff first, and try and remember what you did yesterday!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway the real point of this post is here&#8217;s how to telnet in to a mail server which I found really cool.

Where I want it, is in documents that are easy to repurpose for who knows what in the future. I write most things in <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a> so at this point in time Jekyll seems to fit with these current thoughts.</li>\n<li>I exchanged <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gavinwye/status/368674918809890817\">Tweets</a> with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markirby\">@markkirby</a> at the weekend, He’s thinking of doing the same and we said we would exchange notes at <a href=\"http://2013.dconstruct.org/\">dConstruct</a> in September, I don’t want to turn up empty handed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I’ll try to document the process but all I have at the moment are the questions below which I’ll come back and answer as and when.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Should I host the static pages on a server? I’ll host in in AWS anyway but do I need the extra power of the server</li>\n<li>Should I try to set an <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html\">AWS bucket</a> and serve it from there?</li>\n<li>If I set up an S3 bucket can I find a good simple way to mount it locally so that the deployment is easy?</li>\n<li>Can I script deployment to this S3 bucket so that when I write something and I’m ready to be published it’s quick and easy?</li>\n<li>Can I use <a href=\"http://hammerformac.com/\">Hammer For Mac</a> in some way or will I have to use <a href=\"http://middlemanapp.com/\">Middleman</a>?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I’ll update this post as I go with more questions and answers as I come to them. But for the time being if you have answers to any of these please use the comments below.</p>\n"},"Date":"2013-08-19T00:00:00Z"}}
