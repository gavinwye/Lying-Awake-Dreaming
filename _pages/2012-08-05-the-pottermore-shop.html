<h1>The Pottermore Shop</h1>

<p>I was the lead user experience designer for The Pottermore Shop. Initially I worked with the product owner and other senior stakeholders to define the minimum viable product. Then with Pottermore and their eCommerce delivery partner to help them get from vision to launch. Working with multiple people - business analysts, platform architects, client side developers and project managers - in a collaborative environment.</p>

<p>Initially we had a series of workshops to define the requirement with stakeholders. We then went on to sketch out the complete experience so that we had a shared understanding of how the experience would look. During this time we started to define design principles that would be used later to ade the decision making process. We Defined three personas which were used during the latter stages of the design and usability testing to check the design and by an external agency to recruit participants for usability testing.</p>

<p>We carried out two rounds of usability testing during the project.This allowed us to fix potentially costly problems before launch. One of the clients biggest concernes was that there would be lots of support requests from people who were new to downloading eBooks. One of the biggest successes of these two rounds of testing was the fact that the client was able to prioritise the features for launch against data that was collected. This allowed us to prioritise usability bugs over new features. In fact the client made the decision to delay launch and fix issues rather than risk launching with usability issues. This decision was validated in the days after launch, where support requests were less than 5% of total transactions. As opposed to the 15% anticipated.</p>

<p>During the first week the Pottermore Shop took over Â£3 Million in sales.</p>
