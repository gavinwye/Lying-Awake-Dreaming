<h3>HM Revenue & Customs Design System</h3>

<p>I identified the need for the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) Design System to standardise user interface patterns. <a href="#">More.</a></p>

I identified the need for the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) Design System to standardise user interface patterns. Leading a multidisciplinary team of designers and engineers in cataloging and documenting design patterns and building them out into the HMRC Design System.

I recognised many strategic opportunities to collaborate with the Government Digital Service (GDS) on research and design activities, building a collaborative relationship with the Design System team at GDS.

I started weekly calls across government to share knowledge and support between departments and worked closely with GDS to transform this group into a cross-government working group to curate and maintain the Design System.
I recruited critical members of the team to continue this work.

During discovery, I identified that the Government Digital Service was starting a similar project. I recognised many opportunities to collaborate with GDS on research and design activities, building a collaborative relationship with the Design System team.

To start the design system I facilitated workshops with other designers across HMRC auditing digital services to understand how many differing design patterns were being used by services. The results of this audit formed the bases of the backlog which we shared openly across government.

I set up and curated a working group within HMRC to manage and work through the backlog of patterns and developed a process/system by which new patterns could be developed.

The HMRC design system has now successfully shared design patterns right across government.
