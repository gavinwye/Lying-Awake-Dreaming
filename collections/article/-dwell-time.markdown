<p>Shouldn't we be focussing on less not more dwell time? With sites that serve as utilities people want them to soothe task that they are designed for and get out of the way. Also I want to be able to do the core task quickly not have to login and get to the thing I want to do it should just be there right in front of me. Take done not done watching videos the last thing I'm going to do is login on a Monday and mark the videos I've watched. I don't know about you but my girlfriend moans when inning my phone all the time checking twitter if marking a vid a s watches isn't easy I'm unlikely to be afforded the time to do it. 
So we have to think about context if I'm at the cinema can you show me the films that are on at that time so I can easily check off films. 
U hear debs say thes to complex. What try are actually saying is I isn't care enough about the business to make it happen</p>
