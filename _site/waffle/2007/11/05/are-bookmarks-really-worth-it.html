<h1>Are bookmarks really worth it</h1>

		<p>Using del.ico.us is fine but I tend to keep things in there and forget about them. Which poses the question do I really need it if it&#39;s not been used for a while. I collect a lot of things which I don&#39;t really need just in case I need them at some point.</p>

<p>What works really well us using a combination of Google and my browsers history for bookmarks. It&#39;s not quite as good as del.ico.us because some times I cant find things but the things that I use often I don&#39;t get from my bookmarks I know the URL or how to find them in Google or my browser auto completes them. So is there a better way of working that makes use of this kind of system?</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.rememble.com/">rememble</a> which looks good but wont really replace del.ico.us and is so new that it doesn&#39;t work well with Firefox yet.</p>

<p>I suppose the point that I am making here is that I need some kind of service that is a combination of all of these things. Something that tells me when and where I was when I bookmarked this item that would make it much easier to find things in the future. In the mean time I guess that I can just stick to using del.ico.us which means that I will have to try and remember what i have tagged certain things.</p>

<p>As I write this I&#39;m thinking of something that Google could do with bookmarks just like del.ico.us but with all the data that they have on search terms they could better understand what is on a page and help me to tag similar items.
