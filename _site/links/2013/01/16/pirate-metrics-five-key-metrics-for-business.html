<p>Looks very interesting. I like the simplicity of having five things that you focus on.</p>

<ul>
<li>Acquisition - Come from various channels</li>
<li>Activation - enjoy a 'happy' first experience'</li>
<li>Retention - come back, and visit many more times</li>
<li>Referral - like enough to tell others</li>

</ul>
