		<!-- <p><p>I use Apple&#39;s Mail.app which is fine it is integrated nicely in to my work flow, It links to <a title="Daylight" href="http://marketcircle.com/daylite/index.html" target="_blank">Daylight</a> via DMI and most of the time it just works. However I get a lot of mail and I&#39;ve been getting more and more busy lately so I have stopped checking the not important stuff. The sort of stuff that I don&#39;t want to junk but don&#39;t want to read now.</p>

<p>So I created a rule quickly (which is where everything went wrong) to put everything from the people whose mail I hadn&#39;t read in the last month in a folder called NQJBNTI (Not Quite Junk But Not That Important). I did it just before <a title="Business Bricks" href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/215585/" target="_blank">Business Bricks</a> on Friday and then someone came in so I didn&#39;t finish the task properly. I just shut my laptop and forgot about it.</p>

<p>Because I had forgotten about the rule and not checked my mail for the rest of Friday or the weekend by the time it got to Monday and I checked my mail and didn&#39;t get some mails from people who had sent them to me I immediately thought it must have been a problem with the mail server.</p>

<p>I spoke to <a title="Symon" href="http://homepage.mac.com/symonc/" target="_blank">Symon</a> and he told me to telnet in to the mail server so that I could see if there was mail there (this is apparently the same protocol as mail.app uses) so that proves that mail is working. I installed Packet Peeper to sniff the packets and everything is working fine. I created a new mail account and could receive mail on that account. So the server is working and so is mail.app. Then Dave said the only thing left is a problem with rules but I can&#39;t see that being a problem! Rules I did something in there on Friday! I checked and the rule was set to exclude all mail from my in box unless it was from one person. Doh!</p>

<p>So the moral of the story is check the simple stuff first, and try and remember what you did yesterday!</p>

<p>Anyway the real point of this post is here&#39;s how to telnet in to a mail server which I found really cool. I love stuff like this and here&#39;s a record for when I forget.</p>

<p>Open the terminal
at the prompt ($) type telnet mailservername 110
you should get a message back like Ok hello there
type the following
USER username
It will then ask for the password for the account type:
PASS password
you should then get a logged in message
type list
you will then see a list of all the mail on the serve to read the mail type
retr 1 (where 1 is the number of the mail)
to quit type quit</p>

    <li>edit the local hosts file<em> located at /etc/hosts</em>.</li>
    <li>copy an instance in the standard drupal files in to the place where the working copy is going to be kept in my case <em>/Volumes/Local_Work/svn/<em>siteroot</em></em>.</li>
    <li>go to the alias that you have set up in the hosts file which should match the alias that you set up in the httpd.conf file.</li>
    <li>you should see the drupal page telling you that it cant access the database.</li>
    <li>open your MySQL GUI create a new database.</li>
    <li>change the permissions on the settings file to 777 (just for the time being) in the drupal site. <em>located at /sites/default/</em></li>
    <li>go back to your browser and refresh the page you should now see a page asking you to set up the database.</li>
    <li>change the database to the same name as the one you set up in step 7.</li>
    <li>you then have to log in to the drupal site (normally this is when I create the admin user and password if it&#39;s local I just use a crap password but don&#39;t forget to change it later once its semi live).</li>
    <li>thats it you should now be able to customise the site.</li>

		<!-- <p><p>Today I received what I think was the normal weekly email from the airline Monarch. This time I thought rather than just ignoring it I would opt out of their marketing campaign and free my inbox of some unwanted email.</p>

<p>So I scrolled down to the bottom of the mail and clicked on the unsubscribe link, which took me to the Monarch website and asked me to sign in to change my preferences. This was the first thing that annoyed me I just wanted to unsubscribe not change my preferences. Anyway I didn&#39;t know I had an account so tried my usual username and password and that didn&#39;t work so I went through the trial and error process of putting everything I could think of in until it finally let me in. I used the trial and error process rather than requesting a new password because by this point I had already lost confidence in the site, and though that the password retrieval process would take longer than guessing.</p>

<p>So I finally got in and then expecting to be greeted with a screen that would allow me to unsubscribe. Oh no, I was just dumped on my account page telling me that I was already unsubscribed so just to be sure I clicked through and found out that I was indeed unsubscribed and had some vague recollection of unsubscribing a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>So thats half an hour of my life wasted and still receiving spam from Monarch. Thanks Monarch I have now lost all confidence in you holding my data if you can&#39;t do something simple like check that I would like to receive email before you send it to me.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what IMHO Monarch should have done.</p>

<p>Customer. &quot;I want to opt out of you email marketing.&quot;</p>

<p>Monarch. &quot;Oh, okay we are sorry to hear about that. Please get in touch with us if you change your mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Customer. &quot;Thanks, I will.&quot;</p>

<p>Simple as that and it stops negative PR from blog posts like this.</p>

First of all there is a tab labeled experimental. They are setting my expectations right from the start. and then at the bottom of the window there is a button that says special do not press.

And that led me to tell Pete who sits next to me.</li></ol></div><p /><div>And thats why I love it. Because it's remarkable, it's a great app but most of all I love it for being remarkable.

		<!-- <p><p>Here&#39;s a few to kick of the new year.
<ul>
    <li>Learn about fine Scotch Whiskey and how to differentiate the good from the bad.</li>
    <li>Learn about Oysters and eat more of them.</li>
    <li>Forage for more food including going fishing every now and then.</li>
    <li>Write at lease one post here every week.</li>
    <li>Do things that are productive and add value.</li>
    <li>Don&#39;t be a slave to email.</li>
    <li>Don’t moan about things instead frame the problem and find a solution.</li>
</ul>
I&#39;m writing all this down so that I can look back and see how I did at the end of the year. I think it will give me impetus to do something about it. I did this when I gave up smoking and that worked.
<blockquote><em>Tip: I smoked for quite a long time, and giving up was really really hard. The best tactic that I found when giving up was to tell as many people as possible that I was giving up. <em>Then you have to do it. Not following thorough would have meant letting those people down.</em></em></blockquote>
It also helps me set some constraints to write within.<em> </em> I&#39;m going to write something here once a week. Hopefully it will be fun, informative and punchy. It will probably be about User Experience Design and sometimes about working culture and the ways that knowledge workers can be more productive. There is a possibility there will be a bit about customer service. I&#39;ll try and limit myself to 500 words. I’m also not going to spend a lot of time composing these posts. I’ll do a couple of versions have a read through and then set it free. I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist and hide things away until they are finished; this often means that things don’t get finished at all or get left to rot. I’ll try not to rant or moan so I’ll try to suggest a solution. I’ll try to be reflective of things that I actually have experience of. I’ll do my research first before I write something so that what I write is informed. I’m not going to worry about if what I’m saying is completely the right thing to say at the right time. It’s about forming and articulating my opinions as I go. So that&#39;s at least one quickly written researched 500 word post a week that is fun and informative. Yes I do like a challenge, and for the record I don’t think I’m very good at writing. I feel like I should say a bit about what motivates me to write. It is primarily to educate myself and solidify my ideas, I always find that once you start discussing things and hear how they sound you can rationalise them. It’s also to make me a better designer, I’ve always thought that as a someone who works in the web industry I should share my thoughts. I think about this stuff a lot so here goes…</p>

That&#039;s not really anything to be surprised about any more most UX&#039;ers sketch nowadays in the early stages of a project.<br />Sometimes a page goes through 10-20 iterations. I try not to think about structure at first and just sketch let the ideas flow it&#039;s kind of using my hand as my brain. It&#039;s done it lots of times before so it knows what to do and I trust it. I have come up with (almost by accident) an copied lots of different styles for drawing things. Boxes, headings, links, drop-downs, overlays.<br /> At times a wireframe will just be a series of lines and I show this to the people I&#039;m working with. I often wonder if the people I&#039;m showing sketches to understand what they are looking at. It&#039;s very hard to talk about ideas such as &quot;when you click this it transforms in to this&quot; if you don&#039;t have this shared understanding. For this reason I thought I would document my visual vocabulary. There really isn&#039;t a lot it its a few elements that I use over and over again. Here they are not very sophisticated but they work for me.<br /> I have tried slightly higher fidelity versions using color to pick out links (blue), errors (red) and success (green) but it always feel like I&#039;m getting in to the territory of marker visuals when I do this and that&#039;s not a sketch If I want to do something like that I&#039;ll jump in to InDesign, Illustrator, Omnigraffle or whatever other app I feel like using that day. <p /> Oh and if your keen to know how I&#039;m getting on in my resolutions just look at the date of this post. Not exactly what I was planning but better late than never.<br /></p>        </div>

It's not really related to the argument of should designers code or not. I'll post my thoughts on that later.<p />
  When I was freelance I worked on a fairly long but ever so small project. I produced HTML wireframes using the 
  <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint CSS framework.</a> The client was the end user so that made it fairly easy. They loved it as they could see it evolving right before there eyes. I'd build something and put it up and they would play and feedback.<p />
  I never had a conversation with them about signing stuff off they just kept asking for more functionality. Sometimes I'd say I don't think that will work, but I'll prototype it for you and we can see if you want. But they paid for the work and then we had something to talk about. Sometimes I'd be right sometimes they would be right, but It's never about who is right. I got paid because I estimated work in small chunks. They got to try out their ideas on the cheap don't forget this was a prototype. A win win.
  <br /> <br /> When it came to the time for visual design I got the designer to work from the HTML. There was a bit of a problem here as they initially preferred the HTML wireframes and asked for the visual style to be toned down a bit. But that was it.<p />
  Then at the end of the project when we had the functionality that we all wanted in place I got the back end guy involved in tying it the back and front end together. I'd been talking to him along the way so he knew what he was getting in to but there was no documentation for him, apart from some comments in the HTML. Now this site wasn't that big and didn't have that much interaction. But there was also no formal sign off the client just took the site and owned it. Everyone was happy.
  <p />
  The important thing here was they came on the journey they tried things that didn't work and they tried things that did. But they knew what was happening. I didn't disappear and come back to them with a solution. I didn't start doing that until I started working in an agency environment. But that's another story.

As experience designers we need to be able to feel what we are designing. Experience is subjective and hard to describe. Unless you can feel it move, you aren't really designing an experience, you're designing a series of moments that will be stuck together based on how you think it should work.</p>

I have Dyslexia (Why they chose a word as difficult to spell as that. To describe a condition where you have trouble spelling and recognising word patterns, is beyond me). However I do find it to be a cathartic experience. It allows me to explore ideas. The trouble with exploring ideas is that your inevitably going to iterate throughout the process.</p>

Capturing screenshots is annoying, but most of time it has to be done and usually it’s you – The Developer – who has to do it. Taking a few screenshots isn’t too bad, but lets say for example that now you are working on a website using Responsive Web Design and you have to take five times as many screenshots at various viewports. That one, two second annoying task has now started eating into your lunch time.</p>
