		<p>I&#39;ve just been given a bit of advice about presenting. I&#39;ve given many presentations in the past It&#39;s a big part of my job but I&#39;ve never herd this acronym before and I found it useful, so here it is.</p>

<h2>S P I C E</h2>

<ul>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Perceived self Interest</li>
<li>Confidence</li>
<li>Empathy</li>
</ul>

<p>These words on there own are not good enough to guide a presentation. They need a rational behind them. I&#39;ll come back and add that later.</p>
