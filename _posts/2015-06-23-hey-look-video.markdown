Email is the one of the worst part’s of most people's life’s, right!

There are loads of strategies for dealing with email. Inbox zero which I manage to do occasionally. When I can be bothered I occasionally aim to respond, file or delete all email’s by the end of the day. My favourite strategy is the one where you hardly send any email, and as a consequence people don’t email you back. I think of this as “you get what you give”. It works, I practice it when I can but I still get a lot.

I started thinking about how to further reduce my email and noticed that I get cc’d on a lot of things. Things that are not directly relevant. Or that I could comment on but it wouldn’t really add that much value.

So I’ve been running an experiment for the last two weeks. I’ve set a rule to take any email I’m cc’d on put it in a folder out of my inbox. It’s worked. I’ve not really missed out on anything important and I’ve been getting through most of my daily emails every day.

Why not give it a go?

After all your job is not email if you spend all day reading and writing emails you’re not doing your job.
