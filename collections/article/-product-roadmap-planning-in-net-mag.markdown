<p>Back in December last year I wrote an article for .net mag titled Product Roadmap Planning. <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/shop/magazines/december-2012-235">It was published in issue 235 which is still available to buy in print on the website</a>.</p>

<p>The main gist of the article is, that as designers we should be focusing on benefits not features. It's very easy in the process of designing something to get caught up in the act of designing. Forgetting the problem you are trying to solve. If we aim to pin everything we do, back to the benefit that it adds for people, I think we would find design more enjoyable, and the businesses that we are designing for would find it more effective.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://t.co/UiDL9ivElq\">It's live on .Net right now so why not pop over and read it?</a></p>
