<h1>What is State of the Browser?</h1>
Representatives from <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/corporate/tech.html#section-chrome">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie-9/features">Microsoft</a> will be on hand to walk attendees through each of their web browsers. You&#39;ll get the skinny on how they&#39;ve implemented exciting new technologies and find out where the web is headed at breakneck speed. Through keynotes, Q&amp;As, breakout sessions and socialising, you&#39;ll get a better understanding than ever before of the browser in 2011.
