<p>If we spent as much time actually prototyping in code as we do discussing alternative options that mean we don't have to learn to code. We would be able to code to much higher standards much more easily. This would give us a much more thorough understanding I how our designs work at an atomic level.</p>

<p>Yes it's hard at first. Things that are worthwhile often are.</p>
