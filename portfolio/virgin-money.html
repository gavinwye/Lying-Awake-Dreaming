<h3>Virgin Monay</h3>


I built and led the design team on an agile initiative to design and prototype a mobile-first version of the Virgin Money website based on the needs of customers. I was responsible for setting the strategic design direction, ensuring the design met the needs of Virgin Money customers and that the team followed user-centred design methods, a process that was new to Virgin Money.

I worked with the digital director to establish the physical and cultural space needed for the design team to work. I created strategic partnerships among the digital and engineering leadership teams and around the business to help build and maintain a shared understanding of design for mobile and to overcome any technical problems early in the design process.

A demonstrable success was to implement regular lab-based user research sessions so that we could provide marketing stakeholders with rapid feedback on how products were used and perceived by customers online. This helped the team rapidly iterate with complete buy-in from all areas of the business.

Initially, we conducted a content audit of the site to understand what content was needed and removed all redundant content reducing the overhead in managing this content.

During the project, my team worked with individual business areas. Inviting them to our regular Friday usability testing sessions. Through this process, we were able to make changes to products making them easier for customers understand and buy. In the instance of Travel insurance, this resulted in mobile sales outstripping desktop sales in the first month the mobile site was live.

As with many of the projects I've worked on over the last four years. This project was as much about educating and managing stakeholders as it was about design.

The resulting design set the standard for digital design at Virgin Money and gave the digital design team a base from which they could develop the mobile site further.

The desktop site was soon phased out, and the mobile site became a new responsive site for Virgin Money.
