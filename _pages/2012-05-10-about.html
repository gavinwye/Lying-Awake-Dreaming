<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I design digital products. I spent five years learning to be a product designer. Two at Kingston College of Art and Design, and then three at The Sheffield Institute of Art and Design. I started out designing and coding, and making the odd CDROM. I then did a stint as a print designer.</p>

<p>In 2004 I attended <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/training/course/85/interaction-design-3-day-course/">Bruce "Tog" Tognazzini's Interaction Design course</a> only to find I had been doing a lot of what he was advocating for quite some time anyway :) It's nice know your on the same page as the guy who started Apples' Human Computer Interaction Group.</p>

<p>I've designed and made furniture to commission and have been designing things as long as I can remember. I currently work in <del>London</del> Newcastle at <a href="www.think.eu">TH_NK</a>, a strategic digital agency as a senior experience designer. I'd prefer to just be called a designer, but hey ho.</p>

<p>I think Design should be taught in Art Schools I wrote about this in <a href="www.designweek.co.uk/industry-voice/design-education-should-stick-to-its-core-strengths/3034639.article">Design Week</a>. A while ago. I've got a number of <a href="www.gavinwye.com/side-projects">side projects</a> which keep me busy when I'm not working. I also write occasionally for <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/search?term=gavin+wye&amp;sort=relevance&amp;ct=">.Net magazine</a>.</p>

<p>I'm infrequently on Twitter where I try to keep moaning to a minimum.</p>
