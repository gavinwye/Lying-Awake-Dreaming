<hr>

<p>Yea, I know colophons are a bit eye-rolley. This serves as a reminder to me of how this was built. </p>

<p>Built by hand using <a href="">Atom</a> on a MacBook Pro in HTML5 using Harry Roberts <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2011/01/the-real-html5-boilerplate/">The real HTML5 boilerplate</a> and CSS initially generated by <a href="https://www.gridlover.net/">Gridlover</a> which I used to set the vertical rhytham. <br>I also use Eric Myers <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Reset CSS</a> to provide some sensible defaults.</p>

<p>Typeset in <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow">Barlow</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Semi+Condensed">Barlow Semi Condensed</a> which are both produced by <a href="https://tribby.com/">Jeremy Tribby</a> and served from Google fonts.</p>

<p>The site itself is served from GitHub pages. To publish changes, I open a pull request against <a href="">this repo</a>. Merging that pull request deploys the site and gives me a nice version history.</p>

<p>I chose each of these things primarilarly because they were the simplest things I could find. After talking to <a href="https://adamsilver.io/">Adam Silver</a> who reminded me that the internet hasn't really changed in the last 20 years and all the things we've done to make things better have really just confused things.</p>
