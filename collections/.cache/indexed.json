If we think about why people make recommendation it&#8217;s often because it makes them look good, think social collateral.

This time I thought rather than just ignoring it I would opt out of their marketing campaign and free my inbox of some unwanted email.</p>\n\n<p>So I scrolled down to the bottom of the mail and clicked on the unsubscribe link, which took me to the Monarch website and asked me to sign in to change my preferences. This was the first thing that annoyed me I just wanted to unsubscribe not change my preferences. Anyway I didn&#8217;t know I had an account so tried my usual username and password and that didn&#8217;t work so I went through the trial and error process of putting everything I could think of in until it finally let me in. I used the trial and error process rather than requesting a new password because by this point I had already lost confidence in the site, and though that the password retrieval process would take longer than guessing.</p>\n\n<p>So I finally got in and then expecting to be greeted with a screen that would allow me to unsubscribe. Oh no, I was just dumped on my account page telling me that I was already unsubscribed so just to be sure I clicked through and found out that I was indeed unsubscribed and had some vague recollection of unsubscribing a couple of months ago.</p>\n\n<p>So thats half an hour of my life wasted and still receiving spam from Monarch. Thanks Monarch I have now lost all confidence in you holding my data if you can&#8217;t do something simple like check that I would like to receive email before you send it to me.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what IMHO Monarch should have done.</p>\n\n<p>Customer. &#8220;I want to opt out of you email marketing.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Monarch. &#8220;Oh, okay we are sorry to hear about that. Please get in touch with us if you change your mind.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Customer. &#8220;Thanks, I will.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Simple as that and it stops negative PR from blog posts like this.</p>\n",

It’s a lot easier to get a site which is running locally as most things are in the really early stages of a project.</p>\n\n<p>It makes it really quick for me to get something on a simulated phone and see how it will look. The alternative to this would be put the files on a server or use <a href=\"http://progrium.com/localtunnel/\">local tunnel</a> or a similar service. However the time it would take me to figure out these solutions would take me away from designing. Which is what I want to be doing.</p>\n\n<p>So I use a simulator to give me an idea of how the design works.

That&#039;s not really anything to be surprised about any more most UX&#039;ers sketch nowadays in the early stages of a project.<br />Sometimes a page goes through 10-20 iterations. I try not to think about structure at first and just sketch let the ideas flow it&#039;s kind of using my hand as my brain. It&#039;s done it lots of times before so it knows what to do and I trust it. I have come up with (almost by accident) an copied lots of different styles for drawing things. Boxes, headings, links, drop-downs, overlays.<br /> At times a wireframe will just be a series of lines and I show this to the people I&#039;m working with. I often wonder if the people I&#039;m showing sketches to understand what they are looking at. It&#039;s very hard to talk about ideas such as &quot;when you click this it transforms in to this&quot; if you don&#039;t have this shared understanding. For this reason I thought I would document my visual vocabulary. There really isn&#039;t a lot it its a few elements that I use over and over again. Here they are not very sophisticated but they work for me.<br /> I have tried slightly higher fidelity versions using color to pick out links (blue), errors (red) and success (green) but it always feel like I&#039;m getting in to the territory of marker visuals when I do this and that&#039;s not a sketch If I want to do something like that I&#039;ll jump in to InDesign, Illustrator, Omnigraffle or whatever other app I feel like using that day. <p /> Oh and if your keen to know how I&#039;m getting on in my resolutions just look at the date of this post. Not exactly what I was planning but better late than never.<br /></p>        </div>\n",

We are lucky to live in a place (Tynemouth) with an abundance of nice restaurants and bars literally five minutes walk from our house.</p>\n\n<p>The meal itself was great. I had Lamb and alex had a Dahl and Dosa style bread. We eat, chatted and generally relaxed, putting the week behind us to bed.</p>\n\n<p>Then it came to time for the bill. The resterant was filling up and getting noisy. We'd finished off our bottle of wine and asked for the bill. We waited, and waited. Eventually after ten minutes we washed again this time it came. We paid and there was an awkward silence as the waitress waited for the card machine to process our payment.</p>\n\n<p>This is the bit where the staff can make what had been a very enjoyable and relaxing experience, something that can be disappointing and tense. We had no wine, no food and we had asked to go. But we had been left sitting there for ten minutes. Asking for the bill is the end of the transaction. It can be handled well or not. The latter was the case tonight.</p>\n\n<p>It's the same for any kind of experience design when people say they have had enough and they want it to stop. It's best to get out of their way and help them exit in the best way possible. They will thank you for it, much more than they will if you keep them hanging around with nothing to do.</p>\n\n<p>People remember their experiences almost entirely by the peaks and troughs and how the end. It's our job as designers to ensure that there are lots of peaks few troughs and a happy ending.</p>\n\n<p>You can apply this to many things. Registration, checkout or un-subscription. While first impressions count a disappointing ending will override an impressive beginning or middle.</p>\n\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n",

Go read it I'll still be here when you get back. It struck a chord with me. Way back in 2009 I graduated from university with a degree in Product Design. In the three years that It took for me to get my design degree I did not once hear anyone refer to any type of centred design not user not activity and not self.</p>\n\n<p>In Karen's post she summarises this in a much better way saying;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That we focus on users is unquestionable. It is so fundamental it almost doesn’t bear talking about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I first came across the term user centred design I was confused. Design is always for one or more people. So why the obsession with defining which type of people we are designing for?</p>\n\n<p><em>Design is a strategic tool that helps different groups of people in different ways. It helps a business - a collection of people - by focusing on what their customers *need</em>. Helping them to service that <em>need</em> for a reasonable profit. It helps those customers - another group of people - to get the products that they <em>need</em> at a price that is right and fair.*</p>\n\n<p>So that we can use design to it's best advantage we need to define who we are designing for. Especially when it comes to designing for the web. The web is so complex and has many different facets. We need to help the people who we are designing for - our customers - focus on these people and target these people with laser like precision. Not doing this means that we can not design products and services to meet the <em>needs</em> of these specific groups of people. More importantly it means that we can't communicate effectively to the people we are designing for, which particular group of people we are designing for at that moment in time. This helps us to make the correct design decisions.</p>\n\n<p>It's for that reason that we must define the people we are designing for. Not for us, but for the other people we are working with who do not have such an implicit understanding of the intricacies of the design process.</p>\n",

Many may not consider themselves speakers, but have great stories to tell, and we want to hear them.\n\n\n  \n  A link to the speaker network is accessible via IxDA.org within both the local and about areas. The direct link to the form is http://tiny.cc/IxDASpeakers.\n\n\n  \n  I'd like to encourage everyone to add themselves to the database as well as spreading the word to those you know that have stories to share.</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n",

        "body": "\n<p>I use Apple&#8217;s Mail.app which is fine it is integrated nicely in to my work flow, It links to <a title=\"Daylight\" href=\"http://marketcircle.com/daylite/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Daylight</a> via DMI and most of the time it just works. However I get a lot of mail and I&#8217;ve been getting more and more busy lately so I have stopped checking the not important stuff. The sort of stuff that I don&#8217;t want to junk but don&#8217;t want to read now.</p>\n\n<p>So I created a rule quickly (which is where everything went wrong) to put everything from the people whose mail I hadn&#8217;t read in the last month in a folder called NQJBNTI (Not Quite Junk But Not That Important). I did it just before <a title=\"Business Bricks\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/215585/\" target=\"_blank\">Business Bricks</a> on Friday and then someone came in so I didn&#8217;t finish the task properly. I just shut my laptop and forgot about it.</p>\n\n<p>Because I had forgotten about the rule and not checked my mail for the rest of Friday or the weekend by the time it got to Monday and I checked my mail and didn&#8217;t get some mails from people who had sent them to me I immediately thought it must have been a problem with the mail server.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke to <a title=\"Symon\" href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/symonc/\" target=\"_blank\">Symon</a> and he told me to telnet in to the mail server so that I could see if there was mail there (this is apparently the same protocol as mail.app uses) so that proves that mail is working. I installed Packet Peeper to sniff the packets and everything is working fine. I created a new mail account and could receive mail on that account. So the server is working and so is mail.app. Then Dave said the only thing left is a problem with rules but I can&#8217;t see that being a problem! Rules I did something in there on Friday! I checked and the rule was set to exclude all mail from my in box unless it was from one person. Doh!</p>\n\n<p>So the moral of the story is check the simple stuff first, and try and remember what you did yesterday!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway the real point of this post is here&#8217;s how to telnet in to a mail server which I found really cool. I love stuff like this and here&#8217;s a record for when I forget.</p>\n\n<p>Open the terminal<br />\nat the prompt ($) type telnet mailservername 110<br />\nyou should get a message back like Ok hello there<br />\ntype the following<br />\nUSER username<br />\nIt will then ask for the password for the account type:<br />\nPASS password<br />\nyou should then get a logged in message<br />\ntype list<br />\nyou will then see a list of all the mail on the serve to read the mail type<br />\nretr 1 (where 1 is the number of the mail)<br />\nto quit type quit</p>\n",

I have Dyslexia (Why they chose a word as difficult to spell as that. To describe a condition where you have trouble spelling and recognising word patterns, is beyond me). However I do find it to be a cathartic experience. It allows me to explore ideas. The trouble with exploring ideas is that your inevitably going to iterate throughout the process.</p>\n\n<p>Generally I start of by listing all of the things that I would like to discuss and then try and pad out the rest of the post. Recently I was asked to write an article for <a href=\"http://www.designweek.co.uk/industry-voice/design-education-should-stick-to-its-core-strengths/3034639.article\">Design Week</a> outlining my thoughts about design education. I have a lot of thoughts on that subject and before I know it I was at two thousand words. I edited it a bit to cut out some of the waffle and sent it of, feeling very happy with myself. Unfortunately I had taken out all of the bridges. The journalist asked me as nicely as she could to \"have another look at it\". Going back to the article and revisiting it with a fresh pair of eye's it was very easy to see this. I'm thankful that they didn't publish what I had written. I rewrote it quickly and submitted it again. This time it was published and everyone has said very nice things about the article.</p>\n\n<p>I was talking to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/stuartpill\">Stuart Pill</a> about the whole experience. As he was saying that he felt it hard to. What we both have in common is the same degree, both art school based. We came to the conclusion that it's a problem that is hard wired in to us. You see we learnt to draw. When you start to draw something you map out the whole thing and then add layers to it. Getting the proportions right and then working in to the detail adding more and more removing or reworking the areas that are not right. I have tended to take this approach with writing in the past and I don't think it's done me any favours.</p>\n\n<p>From here on in it's all about the short sharp post, with a digestible amount of information and a story to them, hopefully!</p>\n\n<p>What do you think? Are you a designer who writes? Do you have the same problems or do you find that something else works for you?</p>\n",

Where I want it, is in documents that are easy to repurpose for who knows what in the future.

Well whenever you update firefox you get pointed at the firefox release notes.</p>\n\n<p>So whats the diffrence? Firefox is bigger than scribefire MUCH bigger in every way. I probably spend 70% of my time at a computer with firefox open so I&#8217;m interested in what&#8217;s new. But scribefire I probably spend 3% of my time using scribefire.</p>\n\n<p>So what I&#8217;m saying is that scribefire have got it wrong they are using the behavior of a giant and it&#8217;s not right for them to do it. The only way that it would be right is if all plugins commanly took you to the release notes upon release of a new version but that would be the worst experience in the world. Scribefire arn&#8217;t there yet. I&#8217;m sure that they guy&#8217;s that make scribefire think it&#8217;s the biggest think in the world and put all their life and soul in to making it great (which it is) but they are probably just a bit to<br />\nclose to it to judge it&#8217;s importance.</p>\n",

It&#8217;s such an inspiring place to work.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always something going on. <a title=\"Ben's blog\" href=\"http://www.redbeard.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Ben</a> did a talk on Geek Habits which he really undersold the usefulness of and I would now like to send every new client on a talk like that. Just last Friday we had a brilliant talk from <a title=\"Link to Cindi Li's blog about the geek social\" href=\"http://www.cindyli.com/index.php/site/comments/geek_social_in_brighton/\">Cindi Li</a> at the geek social (which was very well organised by <a title=\"Rosie Land\" href=\"http://www.rosiesherry.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rosie</a> who had been there all day I dont know where she gets her energy from) where she did a show and tell of her work. Every Friday there is open <a title=\"open cowerking on upcoming \" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/467758/\" target=\"_blank\">Cowerking</a>. Where freelancers and nomadic workers drop in and work for the day. <a title=\"Matt's linked in profile\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/iammatt\">Matt Weston</a> and the guys over at wired sussex are setting up a startup school with the title <a title=\"School assembly on upcoming\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/471749/\" target=\"_blank\">school assembly</a>. <a title=\"Danny's blog\" href=\"http://yandleblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Danny Hope</a> is setting up with the help of others <a title=\"UX Brighton Wiki\" href=\"http://ux-bri.wetpaint.com/\" target=\"_blank\">UX Brighton</a> which looks like it&#8217;s going to be really cool an in my opinion is well overdue.</p>\n\n<p>All this activity has prompted me in to action. I have also decided that it&#8217;s time I stopped just turning up to stuff and did something myself so I&#8217;m setting up the <a title=\"UX Brighton wiki - Critique Circuit \" href=\"http://ux-bri.wetpaint.com/page/Critique+Circuit\" target=\"_blank\">Brighton Critique Circuit</a> a series of groups focused on front end design, interaction design and usability where people can get help advice and support on current projects from other members of the group. This should serve as a good vessel for distributing knowledge around the community, and generally raise the bar around Brighton. I have posted it on the UX Brighton wiki for the time being as this seems like the logical place for things like this to sit.</p>\n\n<p>All in all Brighton is a hub of creative activity at the moment and in my opinion the only place to be if you are involved in the web. </p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s much more than I have covered going on in Brighton than the stuff that I have covered here just check out the <a title=\"Upcoming\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/place/DWFHqjmYApXbYg\" target=\"_blank\">upcoming</a> page for Brighton.</p>\n\n<p>Oh just a small note I have started using the hashtag <a title=\"the werks hashtag\" href=\"http://hashtags.org/tag/thewerks/\" target=\"_blank\">#thewerks</a> when twittering  </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n",

        "body": "\n<p>Notes from two talks at UX Brighton by &lt;a href=\\\"http://www.twitter.com/rajarjan\\\"&gt;Raj Arjan from &lt;a href=\\\"http://hcid.soi.city.ac.uk/cityinteractionlab/\\\"&gt;City interaction lab at the City University London and &lt;a href=\\\"http://www.twitter.com/silverfoxyboy\\\"&gt;Walt Buchan, director of user research at &lt;a href=\\\"http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/\\\"&gt;CX Partners. The event was kindly hosted by &lt;a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/FabricaGallery\\\"&gt;Fabrica Gallery which worked really well.</p>\n\n<p>Both talks were packed full of kit that you may want to buy to help you test a mobile experience. Here's a list of the kit and a summary of the main points of both of the talks. I've intermingled some of my thoughts and past experiences of testing.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Testing in the wild is hard you could follow someone around all day waiting for them to need to use the app or site. But that's going to be expensive and unproductive.</li>\n<li>You could go and watch people using a mobile device in their own home, which is probably going to be quite successful and give you more insight than sticking them in a lab. If you are trying to test a second screen experience this would be particularly helpful.</li>\n<li>Home baked solutions are good. You want them to be as flexible as possible. What you really want is people using their own phone if possible, it's going to remove all sorts of familiarity barriers.</li>\n<li>You may have to accept that the video that you get won't be as perfect as it would be in a normal lab setup. You may not be able to get a picture of their face as well as the screen, you're testing. You'll need to decide which is more important. Maybe start with a shot of their face, so you can remember who they are when you are reviewing the video.</li>\n<li>Why are you filming the test? Is it to show people what happened? Or so you can remember what happened yourself? If it's the former, the video that you take is important, It's there for you're client. Therefore your probably going to want to put more effort in to getting the set up right. <em>Having said that, the last time I conducted some research and presented the video's back to senior stakeholders. I got a real feeling that they were not really that interested, even though I was only showing them small important parts of the sessions. They trusted me to do the right thing for them and just wanted the headlines so that they could make decisions based on that information. Where this video came in useful is sharing it around the team, so that they can reflect on the things people did.</em></li>\n<li>What you are really trying to achieve is, a situation whereby the test subjects are unaware of the camera in the room. You want something that doesn't get in the way of the person. For that reason any sled based approach can be difficult. <em>That doesn't mean you should go all covert and start hiding stuff in the walls MI5 style.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Kit</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Raj had some nice solutions for <a href=\"http://www.wishlistr.com/cinteractionlab\">PC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wishlistr.com/cinteractionlab1\">Mac</a> setups. Both solutions give you a good cheep way to get started.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.elmo-visualiser.co.uk/product-information.html\">Elmo visualiser</a> - circa £300 Place the phone below the camera and pipe the video input in to your computer then record the video with a screen capture app. I've used a similar much less lo-fi approach to this with two iPhones in the past, for testing a prototype. All you need is a jumbo tube of smarties, or something like that and two iPhones. Place one iPhone on the table, with the top butted up against the tube of smarties. Then place the other phone on the top of the tube of smarties with the camera pointing at the other phone. Test and adjust and necessary, so you get the other phone in focus. You can then record what you or the participant is doing and show it to other people on the project. The downside to this is that the video is upside down so you will need to rotate it somehow, I just held the phone the other way up with rotation lock turned on. Coincidentally, if you have a lot of remote meetings. This looks like something that could solve some remote collaboration issues.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Veho-VCC-003-Muvi-Micro-Camcorder/dp/B0029631VI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342029157&amp;sr=8-1\">Muvi mini camcorder</a> £35. Get the test subject to wear the camera around their neck. Your probably not going to want to rely on this as the only video for the test as the quality will probably not be great for £35. This also looks like a great little tool for \"guerrilla\" research. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mrtappy.com/\">Mr Tappy</a> A sled that you can mount the phone on and then point a camera at the screen. The problem with anything like this - as I said above - is it gets in the way of the natural use of the phone.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.measuringusability.com/products/mod1000\">MOD1000</a> $410 (with international shipping) Another sled.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.alrad.co.uk/imaging/FAQ-Machinevisioncameras.html\">Machine cameras</a> Tiny cameras that give you a very clear picture from a distance, you can pan and zoom from your Mac. I'm not sure how necessary the pan and zoom will be. In my experience things happen in a split second in a test and unless you are very quick once you have zoomed in the moment will have passed. Walt chucked this one in saying he was aspiring to it, so there is not much more info than that. You will need to get the right lens as well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Apps</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://rpetri.ch/cydia/displayrecorder/\">Display recorder</a> An app that is only available on a jail broken iPhone.

You're probably going to have to accept that you're not going to be able to be that scientific with a test of this nature. You may have to accept that you can't adequately get a picture of the users face. I think it's important to remember that testing of this kind is part of the design process. Design is about making mistakes and tests like this are just a good way of finding those mistakes.</p>\n",

        "body": "\n<p>In a recent article on <a href=\"http://johnnyholland.org/2011/12/the-corruption-of-making-in-design/\" target=\"_blank\">Johnny Holland Dave Moulouf talks about the corruption of making in design</a>. I’ve been making prototypes for a long time and I think prototyping an experience redresses the balance in the favour of making. As experience designers we need to be able to feel what we are designing. Experience is subjective and hard to describe. Unless you can feel it move, you aren't really designing an experience, you're designing a series of moments that will be stuck together based on how you think it should work.</p>\n\n<p>Let's look for a moment at the world of the Industrial Designer, and assume that they are designing for an elderly person. They would want to consider how it would feel. Would they be able to grip it? How heavy would it be? Are the chamfers on the corners too big or too small? It's likely that they would build or commission a model of their design and refine it until they are happy with it or run out of time. As experience designers why would we not do this? We research our users, document this research in personas (hopefully). We start to design but we need to see if interactions are suitable for the personas that we are designing for. Do they embody the brand feeling? Do they make people feel as if they are progressing through the system in the right direction? Do they give a feeling of security?</p>\n\n<p>Recently, at work prototyping has been gaining momentum. But questions have been asked about what a framework should look like. I have tried to answer some of these questions below.</p>\n\n<h3>Why would you want to use a framework?</h3>\n\n<p>Prototyping frameworks can save you a lot of time. What they also do is ensure that any member of the team can pick up the prototype and move it on. It will allow designers to play and help them explain their ideas to the wider team.</p>\n\n<h3>Should you build your own framework?</h3>\n\n<p>There really is no need you already have the framework you need in HTML and it's fairly well documented over at the <a href=\"http://developers.whatwg.org/\">whatwg</a>. Building your own framework can be detrimental for a number of reasons. 1. Whenever you employ a new designer you will have to allow them time to learn the framework. If you pull together things from of the shelf (web) then there are more chances that new hires will be able to pick things up and get moving quickly. Design is at it's heart about taking things apart and putting them together in a different order to make something that is improved. 2. You will need to support it internally. If you're using framework to save time then you are robbing Peter to pay Paul if it's something that the team using it can't support themselves. What you really need to be doing is building on existing frameworks that are out there. Fork Bootstrap on GitHub and merge in other projects that do the small little things you need to do. The web is all about building on what has gone before. Don't reinvent the wheel.</p>\n\n<h3>Do frameworks harm innovation?</h3>\n\n<p>No. Well not as long as you sketch your ideas first, the point of prototyping something is to move the idea forward so we can find out what works and what doesn't work and make the changes as quickly as possible. Let's look at where innovation really happens at this level of design. It needs to work in a browser, and the thing that is limiting innovation there is the browser manufacturers desire to add in new functionality as defined in the W3C's spec's. I don't really think you can call the process of getting something into a spec particularly innovative. It's more like lobbying and politics than, 'significant positive change' which is how Scott Berkun describes innovation it in his book The Myths of Innovation and is my personal favourite definition. The thing that harms innovation is lack of ability to dream something up draw it, build it and then communicate it effectively. There are lots of developers out there innovating all the time. As designers we need to <em>stand up and be counted</em> and get more involved with the <a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/\">whatwg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.webstandards.org/\">The web standards project</a> and the <a href=\"http://w3c.org/\">W3C</a></p>\n\n<p>To ensure you don't harm innovation you need to step outside of the framework should you need to. If your framework just consists of sensible defaults and a sensible grid then you should be fine. One important lesson I have learned is that if you are stepping out of the framework keep it out of the framework. You want to ensure that you maintain the compatibility of the original framework so that you can merge in any updates that are released.</p>\n\n<h3>How they can help you reduce the amount of time and resources that you have on a project to make something happen?</h3>\n\n<p>I'm not sure a framework will do this. Good design takes time and costs money. You need to be able to let ideas settle. What a framework does do is allow you to take things apart and change them quickly. You don't want to have to start from scratch every time you want to try something. If you're looking at a framework for purely time saving reasons then you're probably trying to answer the wrong question.</p>\n\n<h3>Can we use other prototyping tools?</h3>\n\n<p>There are also plenty of other tools that you can use to create a prototype. I've had very good results with click throughs made in fireworks. Adobe's new tool Edge looks promising. There are a plethora of  other options out there. You need to pick the right one for the job. One of the most important things I have found when prototyping is maintaining the ability to detach yourself from the act of crafting the prototype. But I have a simple rule, If you can't do it in 10 minuets, park it and come back to it later.</p>\n\n<p>In Summary I tend to look at a prototyping framework in the same way a craftsman would look at making a tool. Once you have it you can keep using it and building upon it to make it better. It's something you can keep with you for the rest of your carrier and it will help you to be a better designer adding value to every project you work on. If you're using an application to help you prototype something then you are limited by the features of the application. That's why I'll always favour HTML &amp; CSS over an app that produces something that looks like a prototype. I'd like to hear your take on this. So if you have a view thats what the comments are for.</p>\n",

I reflect on the things that have happened and think of ways that it could have been better. More often than not they are silly ideas that don't have much foundation. However sometimes they are things that I'd like to refine. Writing is as good as any way to do this. A special thing happens when you commit your ideas to <del>paper</del> pixels.</p>\n\n<p>I'm planning to write an publish a post every day this month, in an attempt to kick start the process, and develop a writing habit. I've talked about this in the past and always failed. I don't know what I think will be different about this attempt that will help me succeed. But I suppose it's better to try and fail than just to give up. After all communication is such a vital skill. Like anything if you practice at it long enough you will only get better.</p>\n\n<p>This is my second post, yesterday I wrote on Medium a sort of ode to Indie Web. I'm not sure what I'll write about tomorrow I've got a few ideas brewing at the moment, things like responsibility, helpfulness and questioning.</p>\n\n<p>But first a few rules or principles that I'll try to follow. When I talked to my friend <a href=\"http://www.dannisbet.co.uk/\">Dan</a> about this the other day he looked at me as if I was attempting to climb Everest without any training. But It's all about the rules.</p>\n\n<p>What qualifies for a post and what doesn't? Well I'm making it easy on myself by saying that anything can be a post. However it probably won't be as simple as a link to another site I've got a whole <a href=\"http://www.gavinwye.com/category/blog/links/\">section</a> for that. I'll try and create something. It may be a drawing It may be a photo or I may just riff of something I've read. I'll probably try to post comments via pingbacks and trackbacks to things I read on other peoples blog. I've been waiting for a legitimate reason to get that working properly for a while.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also in the midst of a <del>redesign</del> freshen up and I'll be unveiling the new look soon. Hopefully you'll join me in this little adventure.</p>\n\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n",

There is a possibility there will be a bit about customer service. I&#8217;ll try and limit myself to 500 words. I’m also not going to spend a lot of time composing these posts. I’ll do a couple of versions have a read through and then set it free. I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist and hide things away until they are finished; this often means that things don’t get finished at all or get left to rot. I’ll try not to rant or moan so I’ll try to suggest a solution. I’ll try to be reflective of things that I actually have experience of. I’ll do my research first before I write something so that what I write is informed. I’m not going to worry about if what I’m saying is completely the right thing to say at the right time. It’s about forming and articulating my opinions as I go. So that&#8217;s at least one quickly written researched 500 word post a week that is fun and informative. Yes I do like a challenge, and for the record I don’t think I’m very good at writing. I feel like I should say a bit about what motivates me to write. It is primarily to educate myself and solidify my ideas, I always find that once you start discussing things and hear how they sound you can rationalise them. It’s also to make me a better designer, I’ve always thought that as a someone who works in the web industry I should share my thoughts. I think about this stuff a lot so here goes…</p>\n",

        "body": "\n<p>I was chatting to <a href=\"http://yandleblog.com/\">Danny</a> this morning about a problem he was asked to solve convincing a senior manager that Information Architecture (IA) is a good idea. Off the cuff I came up with this solution. He thought was worthy of a post so here it is.</p>\n\n<p>You should use this tactic when you are working with somone who has a big personality and just thinks that things that you do are crap. It&#8217;s sort of cruel &#8217;cos your going to humiliate them to a certain extent, or at least thats the point. To point out the obvious which is that Information Architecture is the most important thing in a web project (probably there are probably other things that are more important like getting paid so don&#8217;t embarrass them to much)</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Get a load of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Quercetti-Magnetic-Alphabet-Lower-Pieces/dp/B00068OJNU/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=toys&amp;qid=1208093357&amp;sr=8-1\">fridge magnets / letters</a> its important that they are simple fridge magnets, as they have a lot of connotations with children and will help to simplify the point and bring it right down to ground level.</li>\n\t<li>Put all of the fridge magnets in a bin do this in front of the audience to build up the drama, you should make a lot of noise as you put them in the bin.</li>\n\t<li>Withhold one of the magnets, this is important.</li>\n\t<li>Ask the subject to look for the magnet that you have, don't leave it so long that they have a chance to find out that the letter isn't there, otherwise they will get hung up on the fact that you cheated and the whole point of the exercise will be lost.</li>\n\t<li>Stop them and tip the magnets on to the floor.</li>\n\t<li>Ask them to arrange the magnets in a way the they would find it easy to find individual ones. Your making them do a card sort here so they can't argue that they don't want to pay for this.</li>\n\t<li>Then ask them to find the same magnet / letter.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hopefully you should have justified IA by now if they don&#8217;t get it by that time then your in trouble &#8216;cos you just had a man in a suite crawling around on the floor arranging the alphabet.</p>\n\n<p>The staging of this will be important. You need to ask them to follow your instructions and get them to play along. It may be a good idea to do this in relative private there is a chance that they could be embarrassed by playing with kids toys.</p>\n",

It's not really related to the argument of should designers code or not. I'll post my thoughts on that later.<p />\n  When I was freelance I worked on a fairly long but ever so small project. I produced HTML wireframes using the \n  <a href=\"http://www.blueprintcss.org/\">Blueprint CSS framework.</a> The client was the end user so that made it fairly easy. They loved it as they could see it evolving right before there eyes. I'd build something and put it up and they would play and feedback.<p />\n  I never had a conversation with them about signing stuff off they just kept asking for more functionality. Sometimes I'd say I don't think that will work, but I'll prototype it for you and we can see if you want. But they paid for the work and then we had something to talk about. Sometimes I'd be right sometimes they would be right, but It's never about who is right. I got paid because I estimated work in small chunks. They got to try out their ideas on the cheap don't forget this was a prototype. A win win.\n  <br /> <br /> When it came to the time for visual design I got the designer to work from the HTML. There was a bit of a problem here as they initially preferred the HTML wireframes and asked for the visual style to be toned down a bit. But that was it.<p />\n  Then at the end of the project when we had the functionality that we all wanted in place I got the back end guy involved in tying it the back and front end together. I'd been talking to him along the way so he knew what he was getting in to but there was no documentation for him, apart from some comments in the HTML. Now this site wasn't that big and didn't have that much interaction. But there was also no formal sign off the client just took the site and owned it. Everyone was happy.\n  <p />\n  The important thing here was they came on the journey they tried things that didn't work and they tried things that did. But they knew what was happening. I didn't disappear and come back to them with a solution. I didn't start doing that until I started working in an agency environment. But that's another story.\n</p>\n",

I have little energy or the motivation to attempt to change change the signature that I use at work although I do drop it from time to time when it adds weight to emails and I don't think im supposed to!</p>\n\n<p>However the thing I can change is the signature that I use on my personal email.

But the real question I should be asking is what situations are people likely to be in when they need to contact me? The obvious answer is my mum has my phone number and has only ever sent me one email so I dont need to have a signature at all.

        "body": "\n<p>Since reading <a href=\"http://www.contentstrategy.com/\">Content Strategy</a> last summer I&#8217;ve been thinking loads about how I go about designing sites that are informed by a content strategy and even those sitest that are not.</p>\n\n<p>A content out approach…</p>\n\n<p>So heres where I&#8217;ve got to so far. How can the process that we use to design and build websites empower the content. How can we ensure the the people we are designing sites for, get the content they want. How can we convince clients that this is the content that there customers want.</p>\n\n<p>Well in my opinion it goes a lot further back in the design process than the content actually it starts with research. Take your resurch and boil it down in to things (tasks or goals) that people want to do. Make sure that the content that your commissioning or that your client is providing fulfils these goals.</p>\n\n<p>Start designing from the content out. Start with real content in your wireframes and make sure that from the ground up the content is structured well. First on paper and then creating documents I&#8217;m thinking about doing this in html and just start creating links between the content. You don&#8217;t have to have complete finished content it can be really sketchy at the moment but the content should always aid your customers in the goals or tasks that you said you wanted to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>The good thing about this approch is that you cant help but design it inclusivley. Your not using any CSS at the moment or javascript this is just building a very simple old fashined website without any fluff. So now you have something that is designed inclusivley. It&#8217;s going to work fore people without javascript and for people who dont have flash.</p>\n\n<p>The good thing about this content out approch is that you can start thinking about how all the contnet fits together right from the start. I&#8217;d advocate putting this in front of clients very early and letting them ask questions of the content.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s very early days for me with this approach and I&#8217;m yet to use it in a live project but I&#8217;ll post back here when I&#8217;ve been working it a bit and let you know how it&#8217;s going. I&#8217;d be interested to know if anyone else is using a similar approach to this or even if I&#8217;m just stating the obvious.</p>\n\n",

        "month": "10",
        "body": "\n<p>You&#8217;ve convinced the client they should not be shipping a product loaded full of features that their customers will likely never use. But how do you then get the right features in to the backlog? How do you ensure that these features will add to the usefulness of the product, and that they are not added on a whim?</p>\n\n<p>A product crammed full of features that do not provide a tangible benefit for the business and its customers is not really a very good product. In fact lots of features bundled together is just that: a bundle of features. To make a good product you need to glue all of the features together with something that means something to the people who are going to be using the product. This glue also needs to provide value for the people who are producing the product. This glue in my opinion should be the benefit that the product provides for these two very different groups of people.</p>\n\n<p>Ask any half decent salesman if they sell features or benefits and he will most likely recite verbatim &#8220;Sell benefits not features&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>So why when we are building products for the web do we constantly fall in to the trap of prioritising features and forget about the benefits these features provide, for our customers? Because a feature is a lot easier to estimate and build than a benefit.</p>\n\n<p>Benefits take time to think about and communicate to people. Sometimes the benefit is only clear when a few different features are grouped together.</p>\n\n<p>Take Basecamp, the popular project collaboration tool from 37 Signals for example. If you list its features you&#8217;d get something like; to-do list, messaging, calendar, file storage with optional group chat and writing. Take away one of the first four of those features and you loose the benefit, collaboration. Yes, granted some of them are not mutually exclusive. The to-do list for example is a stand alone product Ta-Da List. But the benefit is different and so are the users.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.gavinwye.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Basecamp.png\" alt=\"Basecamp, the popular project collaboration tool from 37 Signals\" /></p>\n\n<p>If the benefit is not intrinsically linked to the feature or group of features it&#8217;s all too easy for them to be prioritised upwards or downwards according to the most important or loudest person’s viewpoint. That doesn&#8217;t matter too much if you have a small consistent team who all own the vision, but this isn’t scalable on a large project with multiple stakeholders. Helping people to make the right decision for the product, by providing a clear decision making framework can be very helpful.</p>\n\n<p>So we need to start ensuring that all of the features that we design and build are intrinsically linked to the benefit that they provide. But how can we do that? There are two key things that we can start to think about. Alignment and mapping.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.gavinwye.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/workshop.jpg\" alt=\"Mapping out the features and aligning them to the benefits they provide at a high level\" /></p>\n\n<p>Alignment means that everything that you are doing should be directly aligned to the vision for the product. If it&#8217;s not aligned to that vision then why are you doing it? Either your vision is wrong or you&#8217;re wasting resources on something that won&#8217;t give you or your customers the benefit that you set out to. You must continually check your ideas against the insight that you have gathered. It&#8217;s not enough to know what you are doing. You need to know why you are doing it. What&#8217;s more everyone in the team should know why you are doing it. If people know the &#95;why, the &#95;what becomes a lot easier. You can stop having &#8216;what if&#8217; conversations and start talking about the realities of what you know to be true.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know something to be true then you have two choices: Either do some research to test your ideas or park it for the time being. You can always revisit something later in the lifecycle of a product. I&#8217;m personally in favour of parking as much as possible. The less work you take on, the more chance you have of getting something out the door, and that should be your primary focus. The benefit of building something digitally is it&#8217;s relatively trivial to build and ship something. Change is easy and instant! It&#8217;s unlike any other industry where change is something to be weary of.</p>\n\n<p>It may seem that I&#8217;m talking about a Lean approach without actually mentioning Lean. I&#8217;m not. What I&#8217;m talking about is good design. I do think about Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and other things associated with the Lean movement when I&#8217;m working, but not at the expense of the experience. Minimum Viable Experience perhaps? It&#8217;s just common sense; do less better rather than everything all at once to a mediocre standard. None of what I&#8217;m saying suggests that you should be shipping a half finished product. It&#8217;s about shipping a product that hits the sweet spot. Yes none of this is a new idea.</p>\n\n<p>So lets pretend that you have parked everything that you think may work and are going to design and build things that you know will hit that sweet spot.</p>\n\n<p>You can start to map these features against the benefit that they will provide either to you or your customers. But that still doesn&#8217;t really give you a complete product. You need to start mapping all of this so that you get a few key journeys that you can start designing those journeys. (You&#8217;ve actually been designing for a long time already, design is not just about quietly sketching wireframes anymore.) You&#8217;ll then be able to asses which of these journeys provides the most benefit and prioritise your work.</p>\n\n<p>Grouping features in this way means that you can assign value to them. You also get complete tasks or journeys that can be designed end to end.</p>\n\n<p>I worked on an agile project a few years ago and we didn&#8217;t do this. We were designing to user stories which had been prioritised against the amount of effort that they would take to complete. Both from a development and design perspective. Towards the end of the project, we started to notice &#8216;cracks&#8217; appearing. These &#8216;cracks&#8217; appeared in the gaps between sprints. We went back and filled in these cracks and everything worked fine. Looking back now, it wasn&#8217;t as big a drama as it felt at the time. But there were two valuable lessons. Sketching out wireframes is not where the design starts or ends, and when it seems as if your world is falling apart the problem is probably not as big as you think it is. The design starts well before this in the initial stages of the project. The tools of choice for this are experience maps and user journeys. If you&#8217;re not inputting into the initial stages of the project plan - which as I said is really design - and the roadmap for the product, you&#8217;re not doing your job as a designer.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.gavinwye.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wirejourney.jpg\" alt=\"I find mapping out the experience from end to end in this way, leaving out lots of the detail only focusing on the important parts, helps people get a good idea how the journey works.\" /></p>\n\n<p>Aligning and mapping features and benefits in this way means that you can decide where you should be spending your budget for the highest possible return. How you quantify that return is up to you.</p>\n\n<p>As designers we have valuable skills that we can use to help facilitate this planning- design process. But we would be foolish to think that we can do this in complete isolation. Unless you truly are a unicorn. Spending your own money and defining your own success. Collaboration and facilitation are the keys to success.</p>\n\n",

Here's my notes from his talk on <a href=\"http://aneventapart.com/2011/boston/\">What Every Web Designer Should Know</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Increasingly on the Web, everyone can create content and share through social media. What does it mean for how we design Web sites when people can control the presentation of content within your designs?</li>\n\t<li>It’s not just the visual experience that you might not be able to control. Through tools like Instapaper and Readability, people are time and design shifting to experience your content the way they want.</li>\n\t<li>But this isn’t new. People have always been able to experience the Web in different ways through different devices, browsers, and even their own user style sheets. We’ve always had to account for this but it’s more apparent than ever before.</li>\n\t<li>It’s not just how we experience sites that’s in flux. It’s how we define what we do as well. Every year the AEA survey uncovers many different names for the same job: webmasters and creative directors are often doing the same job. People in this profession love to argue about what to call themselves.</li>\n\t<li>Design that does not serve people does not serve business. When you do things that are anti-user, you are designing anti-user patterns. Example: services that spam your address book without you knowing it.</li>\n\t<li>Content precedes design. Design without content is decoration. It used to be that you worked on look and feel before you thought about content. But it’s actually very hard to do design without content.</li>\n\t<li>When the Blogger team asked for design templates, it was really hard to create anything appropriate devoid of content. Doug Bowman made a universal template that was minimalist and ended up on 20 million blogs. It was the best solution for the problem of designing where you don’t know the content. But it’s one of the only success solutions to this problem out there, which illustrates how hard it is to design without content.</li>\n\t<li>Websites are simply delivery systems for content. Even something as simple as a little call out needs to have actual content in order to test out how it will work in layout.</li>\n\t<li>You can’t solve a problem until you can define it. And you probably can’t solve it alone. To help you can turn to design testing with users. But ideas can also come from within. Innovation does not have to come from asking people for ideas.</li>\n\t<li>We all have to learn many things about building Web sites. In advertising people kept secrets from each other but on the Web people share what they learn. We’re all interested in each other’s techniques so we can learn.</li>\n\t<li>Right now is the best time to create Web sites and applications. New opportunities like Webkit &amp; mobile, html5 &amp; css3, UX &amp; content strategy.</li>\n\t<li>Many times when we say mobile we are often talking about small screen. Small screen design adapts by adjusting layout and media to fit on smaller viewports. If you are primarily a content site, you might need a small screen strategy not a full mobile strategy.</li>\n\t<li>Real Web designers write code. Always have. Always will. You need to at least understand the principles of semantic mark-up and know what is possible with HTML and CSS.</li>\n\t<li>Progressive enhancement is a universal smart default. Most of agree that it’s a best practice to create an experience that can reach everyone.</li>\n\t<li>HTML5 has design principles that also apply to Web design. Pave the cowpaths = make things work based on how people expect it to work. Find a way to make things work even if people try to “wrong” thing. Fail predictably.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"posterous_quote_citation\">via <a href=\"http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1311\">lukew.com</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

He'd been shot at, shot at people and seen friends shot. Running in to a fight in his world leads to you and other people around you getting shot and possibly killed. He said it in a way that gave it such gravitas that I remember it frequently.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years I've added the last part, 'never start a fight you can't win'. Recently I've been working on a project that has unwittingly come to embody this little slogan. Not that the other people who are involved in the project actually know this. But so far the project has gone without a hitch.</p>\n\n<p>Meetings with clients have felt well rehearsed everyone know what they are expected to do and plays their part. In short there have been no surprises. We have shared <del>deliverables</del> artefacts with clients well in advance of the meeting's. I used to think this kind of forward planning spoiled the show, but I was wrong. I used to lack the conviction in my ideas and rationale and written communication that would prevent me from sharing things. I preferred instead to ambush clients with my brilliance. Again I was wrong.</p>\n",

We go to extreme lengths to communicate with users in a language they understand, enabling them to engage with our messages and feel like they’re part of a story we built just for them. Yet, we do a poor job of communicating with those whom our work requires us to talk to every day—and we need to, and can, get better at it.</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's the second post that I've saved today about communicating and getting better at it. As an industry I really believe that we need to be excellent communicators.\nFor design to truly make a difference and fulfil its potential as an agent for change. Collectively we need to work hard to communicate with the non-designers we work with.</p>\n",

Something that tells me when and where I was when I bookmarked this item that would make it much easier to find things in the future.

Based on a chance meeting with an old school friend who was earning 35K strait out of university. That never happened! But what did happen was the realisation that there needs to be something else, <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html\">this is nothing new</a>. If you know why you are doing something then it all becomes a lot easier. Call it purpose if you like?</p>\n\n<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve always had a sense of purpose in the work that I have done, but it&#8217;s taken me a good few years to understand personally what this purpose is. And I&#8217;ve only recently been able to articulate it in a way I feel comfortable with.</p>\n\n<p>My sense of purpose, the thing that keeps me coming back for more every day even when I have had a bad day is the fact that. I Want to help people. I want to make the web a better place. Now I admit that I copied <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/\">Mozilla</a> or at least was inspired by them. The strap line Doing good is part of our code rings true with me. Yea I know I&#8217;m a bit of a hippie. It feels right to me, and good enough for the time being I&#8217;m sure that I&#8217;ll revisit this again in the future. But right now it&#8217;s the best I&#8217;ve got.</p>\n\n<p>So, the only question I now have is. Can you be a User Experience Designer if you don&#8217;t share this vision? A friend once said to me about User Experience.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  I think in the end we will all just admit that it's good for business.\n\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes it is, what better thing for a business could there be than making it easy for your customers to do business with you in whatever way they want?</p>\n\n<p>So what got you started?</p>\n\n",

It's very easy in the process of designing something to get caught up in the act of designing. Forgetting the problem you are trying to solve.

I think it looks great, possibly a little rough round the edges and a few icons - such as notes and todo's - which could, in my opinion benefit from a bit of attention. But those problems are easily solved and I'm sure they will be before it's launched next month.</p>\n\n<p>However I think we are missing the interesting thing. We now have a Product Designer leading the Graphic Design of a product. The Graphic Design and Product Design are becoming one.</p>\n\n<p>EXPAND</p>\n\n<p>SOURCES\nhttp://www.baekdal.com/opinion/fixing-the-ios-7-icons/\nhttp://mattgemmell.com/2013/06/12/ios-7/</p>\n",

Taking a few screenshots isn’t too bad, but lets say for example that now you are working on a website using Responsive Web Design and you have to take five times as many screenshots at various viewports. That one, two second annoying task has now started eating into your lunch time.</p>\n",

I like the way it&#8217;s framed and the idea resonated with me. So often in the past I&#8217;ve starting something just because it seemed like a good idea.

SkillSwap is a series of tiny free speaking events they have been running in <a href=\"brighton.skillswap.org\">Brighton</a> and <a href=\"bristolskillswap.org\">Bristol</a> for ages. Now it&#8217;s London&#8217;s turn. The first event is in August. Titled <a href=\"skillswaplondon-august.eventbrite.co.uk\">Talking About Design</a> we have two very fine speakers <a href=\"andybudd.com\">Andy Budd</a> and Jonty Sharples](3tych.com).</p>\n\n<p>Website coming soon</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.uxcampbrighton.org/\">UX Camp Brighton</a></h2>\n\n<p>A one day Barcamp style event where everyone is a speaker.

Similar to developer ‘hackdays’ the aim is to get designers, developers, and more together to learn and collaborate with each other while working on actual design problems. The sessions champion open-source thinking &amp; sharing and are non-profit, run by local volunteers. Organised in collaboration with <a href=\"twitter.com/alicenwondrlnd\">Alison Austin</a>, <a href=\"www.cennydd.co.uk\">Cennydd Bowles</a> and <a href=\"twitter.com/patrick_sansom\">Patrick Sansom</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.designjams.org/wiki/Design_Jam_Brighton\">Read more about the event</a></p>\n\n",
