<p>How often do you get an email from someone with loads of spurious information that you don't really need in the footer? It's a vanity thing on the part of the sender – or rather the senders' boss – It shows little understanding or regard for the people you are sending the email to or the internet and certainly does not adhere to the robustness principle.</p>

<p>I'm starting to think about the signature I send in my emails I have a few One that's enforced by work that contains a few images the address of the company a phone number and possibly even a fax number although I'm sure we don't have a fax! I have little energy or the motivation to attempt to change change the signature that I use at work although I do drop it from time to time when it adds weight to emails and I don't think im supposed to!</p>

<p>However the thing I can change is the signature that I use on my personal email. I have three devices capable of sending mail. My Laptop (MacbookPro), iPhone and iPad. each have a slightly different signature and that's purely down to the fact that I havent got round to unifying them all.</p>

<p>Come to think of it I use Apple Mail should't that sync them all across iCloud or something clever like that?</p>

<p>So now I'm left with the difficult decision of what ti include and which order it should all be included in. Over the years I've put everything in form my email to my social profiles. Given that I'm trying to be a bit &#91;Indie&#93;(indie web link) about the stuff that I do nowadays I don't think that I really need or should include lots of stuff. maybe a link to the contact section of my website is all I need. But the real question I should be asking is what situations are people likely to be in when they need to contact me? The obvious answer is my mum has my phone number and has only ever sent me one email so I dont need to have a signature at all. However lets suspend disbelief for the moment and pretend that Im an interesting person and that you may want to contact me.</p>

<p>You already have my email as I sent it to you. So all you really need is my phone number. I don't really want you turning up unannounced at my house so you don't need my address.</p>
