	<h1>About
	<span><b>Gavin Wye</b> <br> October 2019</span>
</h1>

	<hr>

	<p>I've spent the last 18 years working in Digital Product Design and User Experience roles. I graduated from university with a BA Hons in Product Design.</p>
	<p>Over the last seven years. I've helped organisations build strong multidisciplinary design teams and establish hugely successful design operations and practices.</p>
	<p>I’m driven by the desire to make things better, to deliver impactful working software to users as early as possible, meeting their needs, continuously improving and iterating based on user research. I have excellent attention to detail but know when to compromise for the benefit of users and the business. </p>
	<p>I've worked across the UK Government – on citizen facing services for:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">The Ministry of Justice</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/her-majestys-prison-and-probation-service">Her Majesty’s Prison & Probation Service</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/legal-aid-agency">The Legal Aid Agency</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/criminal-injuries-compensation-authority">Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs">HM Revenue & Customs</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>And in the private sector for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="">Virgin Money</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Nando's worldwide</a></li>
			<li><a href="">J.K.Rowlings' Pottermore</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Visa</a></li>
			<li>and</li>
			<li><a href="">Channel4</a></li>
		</ul>

	<p>I've had many job titles over the last 18 years. I prefer to use the word <b>Designer</b>.</p>
	<p>I focus on doing the right thing at the right time rather than obsess over job titles.</p>
	<p>Separating design into specific sub-disciplines like Product, Interaction, Service, Content and even User research (which is a design discipline) is helpful when working as part of a team. However, in general, those words confuse people who are not designers.</p>
	<p>When working as part of a team, it sometimes helps to distinguish between disciplines. But we should not let this get in the way of doing the right thing and delivering value to users.</p>
	<!-- <p>I’ve worked as part of multidisciplinary agile teams – where I’m as comfortable committing code as I am sketching – and with senior policymakers, senior management teams and board members to help them define product capabilities and services that meet the needs of users and satisfy the goals of the organisation.</p> -->
	<!-- <p>I’m highly motivated help teams gather actionable insights from user research, generate ideas with team members then prototype, test and refine ideas further. The focus of this is always to check assumptions as quickly as possible while striving for simplicity.</p> -->
	<!-- <p>I’m an experienced facilitator who has moderated usability testing, service assessments, workshops and co-design sessions. </p> -->
